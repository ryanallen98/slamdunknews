The NBA All-Star Draft happened on Wednesday, but it was not recorded live. **LeBron James and Kevin Durant** conducted the draft from their remote locations, and Ernie Johnson hosted the event on Wednesday. It aired on Thursday night, as all of us realized who was going to play where.

We also learned that “nobody played with the Utah Jazz” growing up. **Let’s meet the roster.**

The Starters
------------

Kevin Durant won’t be playing in the **All-Star Game** as he continues to rehab his injury, so Jayson Tatum received the nod to move into the player pool as the final starter. As expected, his first pick as captain was his teammate, Kyrie Irving.

The next player after Irving was **Joel Embiid**, as Durant made sure to grab the elite big man. The following pick from Durant was also wise, as he took Kawhi “Fun Guy” Leonard.

He got to pick up the final two players due to an odd number of players in the pool. **Bradley Beal** was one of the two. Those Wizards have been playing great basketball for the last month, so perhaps all of the crazy rumors of his wanting out can finally just stop spreading because there is no truth.

And the second was **Jayson Tatum**, who is close friends with Durant. The St. Louis duo.

So to round it all out, the **starting five is as follows:**

Kyrie Irving, Bradley Beal, Kawhi Leonard, Jayson Tatum, and Joel Embiid.

Not bad at all.**‍**

The Reserves
------------

There were no bad picks that could have been made here, but **Team Durant** is looking pretty dangerous. The same can be said about Team LeBron, but still. Perhaps this is the first time that a LeBron-drafted team will lose. They have gone 3-0 in the first several years of the new format.

It comes as no surprise that **James Harden** is here. Durant wanted to make sure all of the Nets could be together for the game. Loyalty. They’re all incredible players, but still. You love to see it.

They’ve got terrific scorers in **Donovan Mitchell and Zach LaVine**. It’s great to finally see LaVine in an All-Star Game, as he’s been deserving for three years. Better late than never in finally selecting him to play in the game. Well done, coaches.

At the big-man positions, they’ve got **Julius Randle and Nikola Vucevic** (whose name was properly pronounced by Durant when he was selected. SMH, Kendrick Perkins). Randle has been a revelation in New York this season, and it’s terrific that he’s finally got an All-Star appearance. And Vooch can score from all over the floor. He’ll play well off the bench.

They have a superstar in **Devin Booker**, who was the second reserve taken by Durant. He can score from every inch on the floor and is going to be rivaling Damian Lillard in his minutes.

Finishing it off is **Zion Williamson**, who was built for games like this. Minimal defense (until the fourth quarter) will allow him to throw down some monstrous jams. He turned down the dunk contest invitation, likely meaning he will likely be able to expend some extra energy in this game.

That, ladies and gentleman, is Team Durant. They will be **coached by 76ers coach Doc Rivers**.
