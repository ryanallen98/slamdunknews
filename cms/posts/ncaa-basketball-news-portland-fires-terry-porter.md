Terry Porter has been fired as men's basketball coach by the University of Portland this weekend after four and a half seasons. Portland has a 43-103 record since Porter, a former NBA All-Star and coach, arrived before the 2016-17 season. Portland won 11 games his first season, 10 games in the next, and did not reach double-digit wins in either of the next two seasons.

The Pilots are 6-12 this season, including an 0-9 mark in the West Coast Conference. Under Porter, the program went 7-69 in the WCC. Four of those Conference wins came in their 2017-18 campaign. However, Portland went 0-16 in the conference the following year.

> Portland's vice president for athletics, Scott Leykam, said in a statement that the "timing of these changes is never ideal, especially with all the disruptions this season that have been brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. Ultimately, it was decided that it was best to move forward now and focus on the future of the program and the search for the next head coach."

Former Blazer Great
-------------------

The 57-year old Porter played 17 seasons in the NBA, spending his first 10 years with the Portland Trail Blazers, followed by three with the Minnesota Timberwolves, a one-year stint with the Miami Heat, and three with the San Antonio Spurs. He finished his career averaging over 12 points and five assists per game.

Porter was a two-time All Star, making the team in 1990-91 and the 1992-93 seasons. During the 1992-93 campaign, he notched a career-best 18.2 points per game. Porter averaged in double digits in points in eight consecutive seasons for the Blazers. He scored between 17.0 and 18.2 points per game over five straight seasons starting in 1988-89.

In 2008, the Trail Blazers retired his No. 30 jersey.

NBA Coaching Resume
-------------------

Porter was an NBA head coach for three seasons, including two with the Milwaukee Bucks. While in Milwaukee, Porter's Bucks finished with a combined 71-93 record in the 2003-04 and 2004-05 seasons.

The Phoenix Suns signed Porter to a three-year, $6 million contract before the 2008-09 season but fired him after just 51 games with a 28-23 record. He was also an assistant coach with the Sacramento Kings, Detroit Pistons, and Timberwolves.

The Portland gig was Porter’s first college coaching experience since leaving the sidelines of the NBA.

Piloting the Rest of the Season
-------------------------------

Assistant coach Ben Johnson was named Porter’s replacement on an interim basis while conducting a full search for a permanent successor. Johnson’s first game in the big chair resulted in a 91-70 defeat to Pepperdine on Saturday, the team’s 10th straight loss.

Barring any covid-related postponements or cancellations (Portland has had four such instances this year), the Pilots have four remaining games on their schedule, beginning with Santa Clara this coming Saturday on the road. They’ll then finish up with Pacific, San Diego, and Loyola Marymount.

Portland has three players averaging double-figure points this season, led by senior guard Ahmed Ali, whose 18.0 ppg is good for third in the WCC, behind two players from the undefeated Gonzaga Bulldogs.
