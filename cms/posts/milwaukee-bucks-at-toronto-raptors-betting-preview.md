Two teams who have dominated the NBA's Eastern Conference clash at Amalie Arena in Tampa, Fla., on Wednesday night when the Milwaukee Bucks visit the Toronto Raptors. This is the first meeting between these two teams this season.

  

These teams also met in the Eastern Conference Finals two years ago, where, after losing the first two games, the Raptors reeled off four straight wins to reach (and win) their first-ever NBA Finals.

  

There appears to be a power struggle in the Eastern Conference this year, though only one of these teams is currently in position to vie for the top spot.

  

Milwaukee is a six-point favorite on the road in this one. Let's dive into the matchup and find some value.

Milwaukee Bucks
---------------

The Bucks enter this game at 10-6, good for a three-way tie for second in the East with Boston and Indiana. Between these three teams, Philadelphia (12-6) and Brooklyn (11-8), the fight for the top seed will likely come down to the final week of the season.

  

After rattling off four straight wins in the middle of the month, the Bucks took two close losses (at Brooklyn and hosting LeBron James and the Lakers). After their game against Washington was postponed, they are back on track following a 129-115 win over Trae Young's Atlanta Hawks.

  

We know about Giannis Antetokounmpo, who is back to his double-double form with four in the last five games. We also know he needs help.

  

Khris Middleton is a reliable second option, but Milwaukee needs more from their offseason acquisition Jrue Holiday. After scoring 20-plus points in just two of his first 11 games, the former All-Star has done it in three of the last five.

  

He is looking much more comfortable getting his buckets within the confines of the offense.

Toronto Raptors
---------------

The Raptors have won the Atlantic Division each of the last three years and six of the past seven, but there is a pessimistic tune being sung about the team's 2021 hopes north of the border. With a shuffled roster and a new temporary city of Tampa (that is 1,300 miles from Toronto), the Raptors' 7-10 start is their worst effort to begin a campaign since 2013.
