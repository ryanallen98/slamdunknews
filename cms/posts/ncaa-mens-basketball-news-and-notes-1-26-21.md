Despite a late start and some hiccups along the way, the college basketball season is in full swing, and the midway point of the conference schedule is fast approaching. Here are some of the latest bits of news you may have missed from the last week of college basketball.  

Wolverines Moving Up but Shutting Down
--------------------------------------

  

The Michigan Wolverines are the latest program to be shut down because of COVID-19 concerns. The Michigan athletic department has detected a different, more transmissible strain of the virus on campus, prompting a shutdown of all facilities. Starting this past Saturday, all Michigan basketball program members were asked to quarantine for up to two weeks.

  

Coincidentally, the announcement comes with the Wolverines at the top of the Big Ten standings. They recently moved into the Top 5 of the polls as well.

  

Michigan is 13-1 overall and 8-1 in conference play after beating Purdue on Friday. However, games against Indiana, Northwestern, and Michigan State have all been postponed. The earliest Michigan could be back in action is February 11 against Illinois, although it’s far from a sure thing the Wolverines will be able to play that game as scheduled.

  

To the Polls
------------

  

Speaking of the polls, the top three teams, Gonzaga, Baylor, and Villanova, remain the same from last week. However, the SEC had a good week with Alabama moving up nine spots to No. 9, entering the Top 10 for the first time since the 2006-07 season.

  

Meanwhile, Missouri moved up seven spaces to No. 12. Florida State also made a big jump, moving up 10 spots to No. 16, as the Seminoles have won four in a row since returning from a COVID-related hiatus. Teams that took a big tumble include Tennessee, which dropped 12 spots to No. 18, and Kansas, which is down to No. 15 after three straight losses.

  

Smart In Isolation
------------------

  

In addition to the entire Michigan program, Texas coach Shaka Smart is currently isolated after testing positive for COVID-19, the school announced on Monday. Smart will miss Tuesday’s game against Oklahoma and likely this weekend’s SEC-Big 12 Challenge showdown with Kentucky.

  

The Longhorns are currently ranked No. 5 in the country at 11-2 and 5-1 inside the Big 12. Texas associate coach K.T. Turner, a longtime head coach at SMU, is likely to take the reins for the Longhorns until Smart is cleared to return. Smart says he’s working remotely and made no mention of symptoms.

  

Radford Suspended Indefinitely
------------------------------

  

Virginia Tech has suspended sophomore Tyrece Radford indefinitely for “not upholding the high standards Virginia Tech has for its students and athletes.” He won’t be allowed to play or take part in any team activities for the immediate future.

  

According to the Montgomery County Sheriff's Office, Radford is facing charges of first offense driving while intoxicated and carrying a concealed weapon.

  

Despite a loss to Syracuse over the weekend, the Hokies are a Top 20 team and in the mix for the ACC championship. Radford is the team’s second-leading scorer at 11.1 points per game. The 6’2’’ guard has also been huge on the boards for the Hokies, averting 6.3 rebounds per game.

  

The school also said there will be no further updates on Radford's situation until the matter is resolved.
