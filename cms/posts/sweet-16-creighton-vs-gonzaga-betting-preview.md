The Gonzaga Bulldogs are just four wins away from achieving the rare perfect season in college basketball. The next team to try to derail them will be the Creighton Bluejays out of the Big East. With both teams getting past lower-seeded competition in the first two rounds, the Sweet 16 will give them each a chance to prove they can knock out more powerful competition.

Tip-off for their Sweet 16 matchup is Sunday at 2:10 P.M. Eastern. The game airs on CBS.

The Numbers: Creighton Bluejays
-------------------------------

Creighton struggled in the first round against No. 12 UC Santa Barbara, claiming a 63-62 victory. In the second round, the Bluejays righted their ship, beating Ohio 72-58 without much trouble at all. The Bluejays are averaging 67.5 points per game during the tournament, but it is their 60 points per game allowed that is catching the bulk of the attention heading into their showdown with the Zags.

If Creighton is going to have a serious chance at an upset bid, they will need a big game from Marcus Zegarowski. Zegarowski has averaged 18.5 points per game through the first two rounds of this tournament and has made just over 50% of his field goals. If he can put together a similar performance to the 7-of-11 shooting game he had against UC Santa Barbara, Creighton might be able to hang with Gonzaga.

The Numbers: Gonzaga Bulldogs
-----------------------------

Gonzaga has looked close to invincible through the first two rounds of this year’s NCAA Tournament. The Bulldogs beat Norfolk State by 33 in the first round and Oklahoma by 16 in the second round. Their offense has been a thing of beauty, as it has been all season long, with Gonzaga averaging 92.5 points per game through the first two rounds of March Madness.

Corey Kispert has been one of the driving forces for the Gonzaga offense so far. He has made 10 of his 17 three-point attempts so far in this tournament, with his lethal shooting forcing opposing defenses to pay attention to him. That has opened up lanes for other players to prosper, including Drew Timme, who poured in 30 points of his own against Oklahoma in the second round.

At this point, it feels like only Gonzaga can beat themselves, at least until the later rounds of this tournament. As long as they can avoid a lapse in focus, Gonzaga should be able to get past Creighton and into the Elite Eight.

The Pick Is In
--------------

Gonzaga’s offense has been working at a level that not many teams in the history of college basketball have been able to enjoy. But that is precisely what makes the under a smart play in this matchup. To have a chance, Creighton will need to slow things down and play in the half-court.

If Gonzaga can get out and run for 40 minutes, they will run the Bluejays off the court. Expect a cerebral game plan from the Bluejays, who will hold Gonzaga to the upper 70's to lower 80's for points, rather than into the 90's.

**Free Betting Pick: Creighton vs Gonzaga UNDER 158.5.**
