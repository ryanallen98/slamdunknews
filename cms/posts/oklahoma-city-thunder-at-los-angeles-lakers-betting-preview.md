Teams at opposite ends of the Western Conference standings meet on Wednesday night when the Oklahoma City Thunder visit the Los Angeles Lakers at Staples Center for the second time in three nights.

The Lakers enter the night 19-6 and just one game back of the Utah Jazz for the top spot in the Western Conference. The Thunder are a modest 10-13 but only two games back of the eighth spot despite having the second-worst record in the conference.

In a matchup that appears lopsided, let's dive in to see where the value lies.

Oklahoma City Thunder
---------------------

The Thunder knew how difficult this season would be after the departing on-court leadership of Chris Paul, but they have done quite well to hold their own in a difficult conference.

The young team (which sports the second youngest rotation in the league) has stayed within striking distance of .500 by avoiding large losing streaks. Oklahoma City has not lost four in a row this season, and it has only lost three in a row twice.

That will be a difficult trend to hold beyond this week. Having lost to the Lakers on Monday, the Thunder now face Los Angeles again, Denver, Milwaukee and Portland in their next four games.

Oklahoma City's success can be largely attributed to the production of Shai Gilgeous-Alexander. The third-year guard has led the team in scoring 16 times and in assists 19 times in the 21 games he has played. Unfortunately, Gilgeous-Alexander will miss his third game in February while dealing with a sprained left knee.

Los Angeles Lakers
------------------

It has been smooth sailing all season long for the defending champion Lakers. Following their first set of consecutive losses at the end of January, they have now reeled off five straight wins.

Another matchup against Oklahoma City continues to fuel a favorable week of scheduling for the champs. It will be their third game of four in a row against sub-.500 teams. Los Angeles' surprise loss to Detroit on Jan. 29 is the team's only loss to a team below .500 to date.

LeBron James is probable to play with a slight ankle tweak. There doesn't appear to be a problem as James has collected a triple-double in two of the last three games. Anthony Davis missed Monday night's game and is considered questionable with tendinitis in his right Achilles.

What To Wager
-------------

The Thunder took the Lakers to overtime on Monday and fell by three points. James' triple-double was enough to overcome Gilgeous-Alexander's 29 points and Darius Bazley's 21 points and 16 rebounds.

The Lakers open as 12.5-point favorites. Prior to Monday's game, the Thunder had lost four of their six games against the top four teams in each conference by double digits. Gilgeous-Alexander played in each of those games.

Back-to-back overtime wins would be an uplifting boost of confidence for most teams. For the Lakers, it's a wake-up call. With James in great form and Davis potentially ready for action, they are due for a wire-to-wire victory.

I'll put my money on the champions to take care of business early Wednesday night.

The Pick: Lakers -12.5
