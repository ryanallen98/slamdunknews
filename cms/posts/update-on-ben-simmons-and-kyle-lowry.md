With the NBA draft right around the corner, here is the most up-to-date league information on free agency and the draft.

‍

On the Ben Simmons front, things have picked up. Simmons was expected to be moved in August, not before the draught, according to league consensus less than two weeks ago.

‍

According to Bleacher Report, the Sixers have not received an All-Star offer for Simmons, which is regarded to be a requirement for a deal. That isn't to say there hasn't been meaningful discussions.

‍

The Toronto Raptors have emerged as a team with "substantial" interest in Simmons, according to multiple sources. According to a person close to the talks, there hasn't been much progress thus far.

‍

Currently, the Sixers have Simmons, and the Wizards have Beal, but the Sixers now want Beal, and the Raptors want Simmons to some extent. One way or another, Simmons is very likely to be on another roster by the time September rolls around.

‍

Kyle Lowry, a 35-year-old non-All-NBA First Team guard, is set to earn an absurd amount of money. Lowry was said to be pursuing a second ring in free agency, according to league sources. While the list of bidders includes playoff or potential playoff teams, the current operating assumption is that money will be the decisive factor for Lowry.

‍

Both the Knicks and the Mavericks are serious suitors that want Lowry. The Knicks are exploring a one-year deal that would surpass a multi-team offer in single-year salary, according to the logic. Lowry is expected to sign a two-year agreement with the Mavericks.

‍

Lowry can always change his mind but the only way to win hum over is to be willing to put serious money in front of him to gain his services.
