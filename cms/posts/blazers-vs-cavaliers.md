The action continues in the 2020-21 NBA when The Portland Trail Blazers improve their playoff chances.

The Portland Trail Blazers (36-29) take on the Cleveland Cavaliers (21-44), with Portland having a 20-13 record against the spread on the road this season.

The Rocket Mortgage Field House will host tonight's matchup! 

Portland's Damian Lillard is scheduled to play, while Norman Powell, with a previous knee injury, is questionable. Darius Garland missed Tuesday's game due to an ankle injury and is being monitored day-to-day.

The Cleveland Cavaliers are looking to snap a seven-game losing streak. Due to their dreadful 21-44 record, JB Bickerstaff's team is just 2.5 games ahead ofDetroit Pistons' bottom-placed.

The visiting Portland Trail Blazers, on the other hand, have failed to win consistently, and they are currently in seventh place in the Western Conference and have a season record of 36-29.
