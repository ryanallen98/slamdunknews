In what was a seven-game slate in the NBA on Saturday, there weren’t many headlines. But there were **several tight finishes**, with three games each being decided by exactly three points.

Cavs Knock off Philly at Home
-----------------------------

Entering action, having won 43 of 47 games on their home floor, the 76ers probably expected to beat the Cavaliers. Tobias Harris or not, they had 10 more wins than their opponent and had lost to them in the third game of the season. It didn’t quite happen like that, as they **could not contain** Darius Garland or Collin Sexton in the overtime, falling by a 112-109 score.

Garland poured in a career-high 25 points and is **continuing to improve** on a game-to-game basis. This is a game the Cavs probably would have lost if it was played a week ago. They got their mojo back with wins over Houston and Atlanta, and now here they go again. After dropping 10 straight, the team has won three in a row.

Joel Embiid dominated, putting up 41 points and 13 rebounds in the loss. He **didn’t have much help**.

Knicks Hold off Indiana
-----------------------

It was an exciting finish at MSG, with the Pacers making a late push against New York. But at the end of the day, it appeared that the natural All-Star Julius Randle was able to outplay the replacement, Domantas Sabonis. It was a wild one at the end, but the Knicks continued to show that **they mean business** this year.

Derrick Rose showed flashes of his prime self, racking up a points-assists double-double. RJ Barrett, along with Randle, drew MVP chants from the limited crowd. And NY was able to overcome an injury to Taj Gibson to improve to 17-17. The East is down this year, with only three teams having winning records, so as of now, they are **tied for a share of the fourth seed** and hosting privileges for round one of the playoffs.

Indiana would have enjoyed having Malcolm Brogdon, but he **was unavailable** here. TJ McConnell had 17 points and 12 assists, playing 46 of 48 minutes.

DeRozan leads Spurs to Win over Pelicans
----------------------------------------

San Antonio hadn’t won a game since before the health and safety protocol, which shut them out of games for over a week prior to last night. It was good to see them bounce back. DeMar DeRozan was feeling slighted for not **being voted as an All-Star**, finishing this one with an impressive 32 points and 11 assists. The Spurs are now 17-12. Surprise, surprise.

LaMarcus Aldridge poured in 21 off the bench, his second straight game **serving as the backup** to Jakob Poetl. On the other side, Brandon Ingram scored 29, while Zion Williamson had 23-14-5 in 35 minutes of action. New Orleans seems to take one step forward and one back. Whenever they get a win, a loss like this ensues.

San Antonio being in the **playoffs is commonplace**, last season-ending a run of 22 straight years making it. But if they can start a new streak, it would show that they wouldn’t even need a rebuild but a slightly down year in order to show what they really have here.
