The **NBA** season resumes on Wednesday night with a two-game slate after an exciting All-Star Sunday night. The **San Antonio Spurs** and **Dallas Mavericks** meet in Dallas for a Texas clash.

This is the second meeting of the season for these two teams after the **Mavericks grabbed a 122-117 victory in San Antonio on January 23**. Dallas has surged back into the playoff picture after an impressive February, while the Spurs continue their fight to stay above .500 in what has been a bounce-back season.

Let’s dive into this matchup to find the best post-All-Star Break bet.

San Antonio Spurs
-----------------

The **Spurs** have been one of the most difficult teams to read this season due to their inconsistencies. It’s not just their erratic play, but lately, whether or not they play at all. A team Covid outbreak ended an East Coast road trip basically before it even started. After the team had four games postponed, they have come back by alternating losses and wins (2-3) up to the break.

Prior to the outbreak, the team had won five of six, but the recovery of teams following events like this has remained a mystery. Their two wins in the last two weeks are over New York and New Orleans, but two of the three losses have come to Oklahoma City.

**Keldon Johnson** was averaging over 14 points per game this season, but he has played just twice since his Covid diagnosis. He only played 33 minutes in those two games and scored 18 total points.

**Trey Lyles** has been a spark off the bench, scoring double digits in four straight games after doing so just once previously this season. His role may be reduced if **Johnson** and **LaMarcus Aldridge** (stomach illness) return to their normal minutes.

Dallas Mavericks
----------------

After nine losses in 11 games in January, things looked bleak in Dallas at 8-13. The lead-up to the All-Star Break saw the team do a complete 180 by winning nine of their final 11. At 18-16, the **Mavericks are now in the #8 spot in the West** and looking like competitors again.

Not only have **Josh Richardson** and **Tim Hardaway Jr.** found their footing to aid **Luka Doncic** and **Kristaps Porzingis**, but **Jalen Brunson** has proved to be a reliable option as well. The third-year guard out of Villanova has demonstrated his consistency by scoring in double digits in nine consecutive games.

The schedule won’t ease up for the team in March. Following their back-to-back set with **San Antonio** and **Oklahoma City**, the **Mavs visit Denver** and then have two “mini-series” against the **Clippers** and **Blazers**.

What to wager
-------------

When these two sides met in January, **Doncic’s stat line pushed Dallas over the top**. He scored 36 points and finished a rebound shy of a triple-double. Richardson did not play for the Mavericks, while Dejounte Murray left the game in the first minute for the Spurs.

The teams are much different mentally than where they were a month and a half ago, but the line resembles the result from last time. **Dallas is -4.5**, with the total set at 222. I like Dallas to win, but I don’t trust them to cover, especially if Aldridge and Johnson are presumably healthy again. I’m looking at the total.

**Four out of San Antonio’s last five games have gone under 222** (if you take only the regulation total from the Nets OT game). **For Dallas, it’s five out of the last six**. Give me the under.

**The Pick**: Under 222 (-110)
