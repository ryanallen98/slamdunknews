Two teams from the Big 12 on three-game losing streaks will do battle in Lawrence, Kan. at Allen Fieldhouse Thursday when the TCU Horned Frogs visit the #15 Kansas Jayhawks.

  

TCU has not played since January 12, as their last three games have been postponed because of COVID-19 concerns. The moneyline on this game is Kansas -1430, while TCU sits at +850. The Jayhawks are favored by 14.5 points, and the over/under is 136.5. Tip-off is at 8:00 P.M. Eastern

TCU Betting Preview: Get Back in Game Shape
-------------------------------------------

The TCU Horned Frogs come into play with a record of 9-5 overall and 2-4 in Big 12 play. The Horned Frogs have not played since January 12 after head coach Jamie Dixon tested positive for COVID-19. The subsequent games were postponed and will be played at a later date.

  

The concern becomes whether the TCU players will be able to knock off the rust in time for the bright lights of Allen Fieldhouse to shine upon them. Teams have shown when they are off for stretches of time due to the virus, they struggle in their first few games returning to play.

  

Before the layoff, TCU had lost three games in a row, most recently at Oklahoma by 36 points on January 12.

  

On the season, the Horned Frogs are led by junior guard R.J. Nembhard. He is averaging 17.2 points, 4.3 rebounds, and 4.1 assists. Freshman guard Mike Miles is second on the team in scoring, averaging 13.4 points per game. Junior center Kevin Samuel is having a solid season, averaging nearly a double-double with 9.6 points and 9.3 rebounds per contest.

Kansas Betting Preview: Get Back on Track
-----------------------------------------

The Kansas Jayhawks come into play with a record of 10-5 overall and 4-4 in Big 12 play. They are four games behind Baylor in the conference standings. The Jayhawks have lost three in a row after winning 10 of their first 12 games.

  

Kansas has dropped nine spots in the rankings during the losing streak, and with a game at #18 Tennessee on Saturday, Thursday's game is crucial to the team's psyche.

  

The Jayhawks last played Saturday at Oklahoma and fell to the Sooners 75-68. Senior guard Marcus Garrett led the Jayhawks with 21 points and 12 rebounds.

  

The difference in the game was at the free throw line, where Oklahoma shot eight more free throws and made eight more than Kansas, which turned out to be the deciding factor.

  

On the season, Kansas is led by junior guard Ochai Agbaji, who is averaging 14.5 points and 4.3 rebounds per game. Freshman forward Jalen Wilson is having a solid rookie season, averaging 13.1 points and 7.1 rebounds. Kansas is shooting 45% from the field as a team.

Betting Lines and Predictions
-----------------------------

This game would probably not be close in regular times, but since TCU hasn’t played in more than two weeks, they will be behind the eight-ball even more. The Jayhawks should run away with this one early and cruise to victory.

  

**Betting Pick: Kansas Jayhawks (-14.5).**
