With a 109-95 victory over the Phoenix Suns, the Los Angeles Lakers won their first playoff game at home in eight seasons and took a 2-1 series lead.

‍

The Lakers were led by Anthony Davis, who had 34 points and 11 rebounds. LeBron James scored 21 points, dished out nine assists, and secured six rebounds. Dennis Schroder contributed 20 points and four assists to the team.

‍

Davies became the first Lakers player since four-time NBA champion Shaquille O'Neal to score 30 points and grab 10 rebounds in consecutive postseason games. Elgin Baylor, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, and Kobe Bryant are the only other Lakers legends to have accomplished the feat.

‍

The Suns kept things interesting by trimming L.A.'s lead to eight points with 2:47 remaining on a 3-pointer by Jae Crowder. But they didn't get any closer.

On Sunday, Game 4 will be held in Los Angeles.

‍

Khris Middleton had 22 points, eight rebounds, and five assists to lead the Milwaukee Bucks to a 113-84 victory over the Miami Heat to grab a 3-0 lead in their first-round Eastern Conference playoff series. On Saturday in Miami, the Bucks have a chance to sweep the series.
