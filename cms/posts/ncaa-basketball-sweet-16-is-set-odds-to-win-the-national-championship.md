The first four days of the NCAA Tournament are in the books, and we’ve been whittled down from a field of 68 to the Sweet 16. Play will resume with four matchups on Saturday and another four on Sunday, with Elite 8 games set for next Monday and Tuesday.

Let’s take a look at the odds on the team to cut down the nets on April 5, beginning with the longshots.

ORAL ROBERTS (+10000)
---------------------

The Cinderella story of the tournament so far, the Golden Eagles have **knocked off Ohio State and Florida** to reach their first and just the second Sweet 16 ever for a 15-seed. They’ve got two legit scoring threats in Max Abmas and Kevin Obanor, and outside of Arkansas, they might have the whole country behind them.

OREGON STATE (+5500)
--------------------

The Beavers took care of Tennessee as the 12-seed in the first round and then bounced out Oklahoma State and top NBA prospect, Cade Cunningham, in the Round of 32. Another national darling in Loyola Chicago awaits them next weekend.

SYRACUSE (+5000)
----------------

The Orange qualified for the NCAA Tournament after residing on the bubble for much of February and March, but here they are again after taking out San Diego State and West Virginia. Buddy Boeheim **dropped 55 points** in the team’s first two wins.

UCLA (+4000)
------------

Our second Pac-12 representative on the list has won three games thus far, beating Michigan State in the First Four and then BYU and Abilene Christian to get to the second weekend.

OREGON (+3500)
--------------

Speaking of the Pac-12, the conference’s regular-season champion shot the **lights out in a win** over Iowa in the Round of 32 and will face another familiar opponent in the final game of the Sweet 16.

VILLANOVA/CREIGHTON (+3100)
---------------------------

The last two standing out of the Big East have identical odds to win it all, and now both must face its region’s top seed next weekend.

USC (+2600)
-----------

Four teams from the Pac-12 have made it this far, and oddsmakers are giving the Trojans the best chance of the group to go all the way. USC **handed Kansas their worst loss ever** in the NCAA Tournament on Monday.

FLORIDA STATE/ARKANSAS (+1800)
------------------------------

Having identical odds here is interesting as the Seminoles face Michigan next weekend while the Razorbacks are lined up with Oral Roberts. Perhaps a sign that the Golden Eagles’ magical run may continue?

LOYOLA CHICAGO (+1300)
----------------------

The Ramblers made it to the Final Four four years ago with Sister Jean cheering them on, and they’re **primed for another run** after knocking off Illinois in the Round of 32.

HOUSTON/ALABAMA (+1000)
-----------------------

Loyola and Houston might be the **top two defensive teams** remaining in the tournament, while the Tide could make a case for being the best on the other end of the floor after setting a new school record for made threes in a season.

MICHIGAN (+650)
---------------

LSU hung around with the Wolverines for much of their matchup in the Round of 32, but Juwan Howard’s bunch was **able to pull away late** to set up an intriguing clash with the ‘Noles on Sunday.

BAYLOR (+390)
-------------

Scott Drew will have his work cut out for him, going up against Jay Wright, but without Collin Gillespie, the Wildcats **face their toughest date** in the bracket by far.

GONZAGA (+160)
--------------

The undefeated Bulldogs were **installed as the favorites** when the field was revealed, and no reason to change that yet after convincing wins over Norfolk State and Oklahoma. Their path to the Final Four goes through Creighton and the winner of the Pac-12 showdown between Oregon and USC.
