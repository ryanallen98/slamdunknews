Russell Westbrook is ejected after breaking an unwritten rule with a late dunk.

 

The NBA has several unwritten rules, and Australian Josh Giddey's Oklahoma City team has enraged one of the game's top stars.

 

In the absence of LeBron James, Russell Westbrook of the Los Angeles Lakers led from the front, but it wasn't enough to beat the Oklahoma City Thunder.

 

However, the 123-115 loss to the Thunder, led by Australian rookie Josh Giddey, had some salt rubbed into the wounds when Westbrook was disqualified late in the game after a passionate outburst after accusing Darius Bazley of breaking an unwritten NBA rule.

 

Westbrook scored 20 points, 13 assists, and 14 rebounds in his first triple-double with the Lakers. He also had a total of ten turnovers.

 

It didn't stop the Lakers from imploding after leading by 26 points early in the game, as Giddey recorded his first NBA double-double with 18 points and 10 assists, making him the youngest player since LeBron to throw out 10 assists in a game.

 

But Westbrook was left angry when, with four seconds left in the game and the Thunder leading by five points, a Lakers inbound miss fell into the hands of Darius Bazley, who put the game away in dramatic fashion.

 

Only Westbrook was dissatisfied. As a demonstration of respect, teams will dribble out the clock late in the game if a win is already certain, according to the NBA's unwritten rules.

 

After his second technical foul of the game, Westbrook ran down Bazley, who was given his marching orders by the refs. In the post-game press conference, Westbrook was still fuming.

 

“How I play the game, I’m more old school,” Westbrook said. “When s\*\** like that happens, I don’t let it slide. In the game of basketball, there’s certain things you just don’t do. The game was already over, and I didn’t like it. Simple as that.”

 

Bazley’s teammate Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, who had a team-high 27 points, also spoke to Bazley after the play.

 

“I know Baze, he didn’t mean no disrespect by it. It happened, heat of the moment. I know Bazley character he didn’t mean no disrespect. If it’s right or wrong (unwritten rule), I don’t know.”

 

While the on-court explosion and post-game comments suggested it was incorrect, social media seemed to think it was alright, especially when the ball landed in Bazley's lap with no Lakers nearby.
