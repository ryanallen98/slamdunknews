A pair of Western Conference teams **on the cusp** of breaking through the glass ceiling clash on Saturday night when the Phoenix Suns travel to Memphis to take on the Grizzlies.

The Suns enter Saturday’s matchup the hotter of the two teams, having **won ten of their last 12 games**, but the Grizzlies have crawled back into the playoff conversation by winning five of their last seven games to break through the .500 barrier.

Let’s dive into the matchup and find a quality value bet.

Phoenix Suns
------------

The Suns are **looking like a complete team**. Though a loss to Brooklyn on Tuesday snapped a season-best six-game winning streak, they have vaulted into a tie for the #4 position in the West. The entire conference is shaping up nicely for an entertaining stretch run towards April.

Devin Booker has **continued his development** this year and is averaging 27 points per game over the last two weeks. Chris Paul has played just as well. He has scored double digits in 24 straight games, and in the team’s win Friday night in New Orleans, Paul registered a season-high 19 assists. The 19 dimes were just two short of his career-high from his days in New Orleans in 06-07.

Memphis Grizzlies
-----------------

Life was hard for the Grizzlies when Ja Morant **went down**, but the second-year stud has played every game in February. He is just three nights removed from posting his first triple-double of the season. He is an assist maven (8.4 per game in February), but his shooting efficiency is yet to return to form (42% since returning from injury).

The only **minor injury concern** for Saturday night is Dillon Brooks. He sat out Friday night’s game against Detroit and is considered day-to-day.

On a more macro-injury level, the Grizzlies are about to receive a big boost for their playoff push. Jaren Jackson Jr. is **expected back shortly** after the All-Star Break. Justice Winslow, who has yet to play a game since being acquired via trade last year, may also return before March.

Without those two back on the floor, Memphis will have to **continue relying** on Morant’s distribution by feeding Jonas Valenciunas, Kyle Anderson, Brandon Clarke, and Grayson Allen.

What to wager
-------------

The Suns enter Saturday night’s game as **four-point favorites**, with the total sitting at 225. There is a lot to like about this matchup with two good young teams.

The Grizzlies are very much a .500 team at the moment. Since Morant’s return, the team is 6-6. In those 12 games, they have had eight different leading scorers, five different leading rebounders, and four leading assist men. They appear to do what a .500 team does, play well against bad teams and **get beaten by good ones**.

The Suns are **beating bad AND good teams**. Among the ten wins in their last 12, six have been by nine or more points. They also have wins in that stretch over Milwaukee, Boston, and Philadelphia.

The Grizzlies need Jackson and Winslow in the lineup to bolster their chances as contenders. Meanwhile, everyone is healthy for Phoenix. Four points is a small enough number for me to **trust the Suns to get the job done**.

**The Pick: Suns -4 (-110)**
