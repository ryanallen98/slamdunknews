With a 129-121 victory over the Boston Celtics, the Miami Heat clinched a playoff berth, effectively relegating the Celtics to the current play-in tournament.

Miami climbed into a tie for fifth place in the Eastern Conference with their 10th victory in 13 games.

Meanwhile, the Los Angeles Lakers defeated the New York Knicks 101-99 to keep their playoff hopes alive.

Talen Horton-Tucker stepped up to hit the game-winning three-pointer with LeBron James out again due to injury. The Lakers are hoping that James, who has missed the previous five games due to an ankle injury, will play against the HoustonRockets on Wednesday at home.

The Lakers are now one game behind the Dallas Mavericks, defeated by the Memphis Grizzlies133-104. After a 115-107 loss to the Brooklyn Nets, the Chicago Bulls are currently on track to skip the playoffs entirely.

The DenverNuggets defeated the Charlotte Hornets 117-112, the Minnesota Timberwolves defeated the Detroit Pistons 119-100, and the Los Angeles Clippers defeated the Toronto Raptors 115-96.
