The Miami Heat and New Orleans Pelicans will bring the first half of the NBA season to a close on Thursday night when the two teams meet at Smoothie King Center. The Heat have **won six of their last seven games** after having their season-high six-game winning streak snapped on Tuesday against Atlanta. New Orleans is coming off a huge win over the Jazz and should carry some of that momentum into their matchup against the Heat.

This is the **second meeting between the two sides** this year, with the first coming on Christmas Day. It was the second game of the year for both teams, as the Heat simultaneously grabbed their first win and handed New Orleans their first loss.

Let’s find the best play for Thursday night’s tilt by **diving into this matchup**.

Miami Heat
----------

The Heat have **clawed their way back** into the playoff picture by winning ten of their last 14 games. After a four-game win streak in early February, their trip out West looked like it was going to be a long one following losses to the Jazz, Clippers, and Warriors. They bounced back nicely with three straight, including a quality win over the Lakers.

The team wrapped up the month of February with an excellent win over Utah and now sits in the #7 spot in the East at 17-18. They are **just a game back** of the #4 seed and 1.5 games ahead of the #11 spot.

Both Bam Adebayo (left knee tendinitis) and Jimmy Butler (right knee inflammation) are questionable to play in the final game before the All-Star Break. Butler has missed the last two games, but in the prior 11 games, he recorded either a double-double or triple-double eight times.

New Orleans Pelicans
--------------------

New Orleans’ playoff chances appear to be dwindling during a bad run of form. Following an **excellent win** over the Jazz on Monday night, the Pelicans trailed the Bulls by double digits for most of the second half in a loss on Wednesday.

Since the team’s four-game winning streak in early February, they have **lost eight of 12** and are now three full games back of the #10 seed (the second play-in spot) in the West. It won’t get any easier after the break. Following must-win cupcake games against Minnesota and Cleveland, the Pelicans’ next eight games are against the Clippers, Blazers (twice), Nuggets (twice), Lakers, Mavericks, and Celtics.

Someone needs to **help carry the load** alongside Zion Williamson and Brandon Ingram. That player might need to be JJ Redick. The 15-year veteran has really struggled this year but has shown signs of resurgence in March. After scoring double digits in just two of his last 11 games in February, Redick has posted games of 17 and 22 in the team’s two games in March.

What to wager
-------------

These two teams are **polar opposites** of each other. The Pelicans are a top 5 offense and a bottom 5 defense. The Heats are a top 5 defense and a bottom 5 offense.

Obviously, the **key to finding the best play** are the statuses of Butler and Adebayo. The Pelicans are 2.5-point favorites, with the total set at 226. Both numbers have the potential to swing in large directions based on who plays and these teams’ playing styles, so I will focus on the player props.

The likeliest outcome from a player prop perspective is a Pelicans player scoring less than their average against a good defense. Zion and Ingram are potential outliers, so I will focus on the third option, Lonzo Ball. **His total is 14.5, and I will grab the under**.

**The Pick: Lonzo Ball under 14.5 points (-110)**
