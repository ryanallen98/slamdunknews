Kevin Durant reaches 24,000 points in his career, closing in on the top 25 all-time list. Kevin Durant's list of achievements continues to grow, with more on the way.

 

Kevin Durant's great scoring abilities helped him reach yet another milestone, with another on the way.

 

On Monday night, against the Washington Wizards, the Nets superstar and recent NBA 75th Anniversary Team honoree recorded his 24,000th career point. Durant is only the 26th player in NBA history to accomplish that milestone. Only three of the other 25 players on the list are still active: Durant, LeBron James (No. 3 with 35,445 points), and Carmelo Anthony (No. 9; 27,423).

 

The next step is a sequence of leaps on the NBA's all-time scoring list. Durant is 362 points behind Hall of Fame guard Allen Iverson for 25th place, with Ray Allen (No. 24, 499 points ahead) and Patrick Ewing (No. 23, 809 points ahead) not far behind.

 

Durant has averaged 1,670 total points a season over the last five seasons. If he matches that total this season, he'll have 25,550 points in his career, passing Reggie Miller (25,279) for 21st all-time and putting him within striking distance of Alex English (25,613) for 20th spot. 

 

Durant, a four-time scoring champion, had 124 points in the first four games of this season. His highest single postseason scoring average (34.3 ppg) in his career came during last season's playoff run.
