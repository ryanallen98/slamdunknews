The Los Angeles Lakers were blown out at home last night in a rematch game against Utah Jazz. 

With leading scorer Donovan Mitchell out for the Jazz and LeBron James and Anthony Davis also out for the Lakers, both teams missed some of their best players.

The Lakers didn't get off to a good start, turning the ball over early, allowing the Jazz to go on an 8-0 run to start the game.

Los Angeles Lakers Jordan Clarkson scored 22 points in the first quarter, and Joe Ingles added 21 points on five 3-pointers.

Los Angeles finally began to battle back as they could swing the ball along the perimeter and open from a distance, sparking a 9-0 streak.

However, that wasn't good enough as Jordan Clarkson picked up where he left off from their first match with a fast 7 points to leave the Lakers, finding themselves down29-23 after the first.

In the final score, Utah Jazz beat the Los Angeles Lakers a vast 111-97.

Lakers coach Frank Vogel finished the game saying:

"These guys are as good as anyone in league with the read-drive offense," "They're patient. They look for great shots at the rim or great shots at the perimeter. If they don't have it, they work the possession until they get it. That's why their record is what it is, and obviously, we weren't good enough tonight."
