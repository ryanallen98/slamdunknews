The **unexpected matchup** of Wednesday night will take place at the United Center when the Chicago Bulls host the Detroit Pistons. Both teams had alternative Wednesday night plans, but due to postponements, they will play each other instead.

The Bulls were supposed to play in Charlotte, but the Hornets’ next two games have been postponed due to contact tracing after playing the Spurs on Sunday night. San Antonio’s next three games have been **halted after four positive tests**.

The Pistons were supposed to fly to Dallas to take on the Mavericks, but the Winter Storm in Texas has resulted in the **declaration of a state emergency**.

Both teams have had games postponed this season, so with intradivisional matchup will help each team recoup a lost game. This is the **first meeting between the two sides this season** after the Bulls swept Detroit 4-0 last season.

Let’s figure out where the value lies with the quick turnaround time.

Chicago Bulls
-------------

The Bulls will be thrilled to have a midweek game to play. Their 26-game total is **third-fewest in the league** despite avoiding a major Covid outbreak.

Monday night’s **return** of Wendell Carter Jr. after an 11-game absence was a huge boost. He helped the team pick up a 120-112 overtime win in Indiana. Carter’s defense helped limit the normally efficient paint combo of Domantas Sabonis and Myles Turner to just 9-of-29 from the field.

The team continues to run through Zach LaVine, who is **averaging just over 35 points** per game over the last five contests. He has led the team in scoring in 20 of 26 games this year and each of the last seven.

Detroit Pistons
---------------

Life as a Pistons fan **has not been easy** over the last decade. A 2-9 start to the year put the team in an early hole, and at 8-19 and the conference’s worst record, they have yet to climb out. Perhaps winning three of their last four is a sign that Dwane Casey’s team has turned a corner.

The strange aspect of their mini **winning run** is in their scoring. Jerami Grant led the team in scoring in 14 of the team’s first 15 games. The last three games have been led by Josh Jackson (18 vs. Indiana and 21 vs. New Orleans) and Saddiq Bey (30 at Boston).

It remains to be seen **how the minutes will be distributed** with Blake Griffin mixed into a rotation of young players at the same position. The former #1 overall pick has missed four of the team’s last 12 games.

What to wager
-------------

Chicago and Detroit have had a **storied rivalry** over the decades. Though the success of the teams has floundered over the past few years, the rivalry remains intriguing but different. The Bulls won all four meetings a year ago, but the Pistons grabbed four wins in four games during the 2018-19 season. Over the last eight seasons, the series is split down the middle 16-16.

I expect a **close game** on Wednesday night. It is going to be a lot of read and react with it being their first meeting this season on such short notice.

The return of Carter has provided a big defensive boost for Chicago, and the Pistons are a bottom-10 offense. I expect the Bulls to continue their defensive form. LaVine also averaged a modest 22 points per game last year against Detroit. The **under is in play** for me. I like my odds at 222.5.

**The Picks: Under 222.5 (-109)**
