The men’s college basketball regular season has reached its conclusion, and we have **officially entered the postseason** portion of the schedule. Several conferences have already tipped off their postseason tournaments, with the remainder (including all major conferences) set to begin this week.

All conference tournaments will wrap up on or before March 14, aka Selection Sunday, when the bracket for the NCAA Tournament is revealed.

Until then, we **celebrate the fact** that the season was played despite a few bumps in the road along the way and hope the tournament goes off without a hitch as well. Over the weekend, the 15 finalists for the Wooden Award, given annually to the top player in the sport, were unveiled.

That list will be trimmed down on March 26, and the winner will be announced in April. Let’s take a look at some of the **key names**.

LUKA GARZA, IOWA
----------------

Garza finished as the runner-up to Dayton’s Obi Toppin last season and is the **only repeat finalist** on this year’s ballot. Following Iowa’s win over Wisconsin on Sunday, the school’s sixth in their final seven games to secure the 3-seed in the Big Ten Tournament, Garza learned that the Hawkeyes would be retiring his No. 55 jersey.

He finished the year with 12 double-doubles, leading the Big Ten in scoring and finishing third in the country.

CADE CUNNINGHAM, OKLAHOMA STATE
-------------------------------

Cunningham is averaging 19.7 points, 6.3 rebounds, and 3.5 assists per game for a 17-7 Cowboys team that appears set on reaching the NCAA tournament for the first time since 2017. The freshman guard is **likely a one-and-done** candidate, with most mock drafts projecting him to be a high first-round pick in this summer’s NBA Draft.

Cunningham missed OSU’s season-finale against West Virginia with an ankle injury but is expected to be available for the Big 12 Tournament.

GONZAGA TRIO
------------

The 15 finalists represented 10 schools, and the Zags were the **only program to showcase** three players. Senior Corey Kispert, sophomore Drew Timme and freshman Jalen Suggs will all be vying for votes after leading the Bulldogs to a perfect 24-0 season.

Gonzaga will face St. Mary’s in the semifinals of the WCC Tournament Monday night and, barring a miracle, should have a 1-seed locked up for the Big Dance.

THE REST
--------

The Big Ten was **well-represented** on the list for the most prestigious award in the sport, with six players from four different schools earning a nomination. The Big 12, widely considered the second-best conference this season, had two. Voting for the award is scheduled for March 15-22. It will factor in a player’s entire season to that point, including the opening rounds of the NCAA Tournament.

Here are the 10 other names **nominated** for the Wooden Award, two each from Illinois and Villanova, including Collin Gillespie, who maintained his spot despite being lost for the season due to injury last week.

Collin Gillespie, Villanova

Jeremiah Robinson-Earl, Villanova

Ayo Dosunmu, Illinois

Kofi Cockburn, Illinois

Jared Butler, Baylor

Trayce Jackson-Davis, Indiana

Hunter Dickinson, Michigan

E.J. Liddell, Ohio State

Evan Mobley, USC

Charles Bassey, Western Kentucky
