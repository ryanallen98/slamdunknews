The **#15 seed Oral Roberts Golden Eagles (17-10)** look to advance to the Sweet 16 in around two matchups against the **#7 seed Florida Gators (15-9)**. Oral Roberts shocked the basketball world with a 75-72 overtime victory over #2 Ohio State, while the Gators took down Virginia Tech, also in overtime, 75-70. Sunday’s tipoff is set for 7:45 p.m. EST inside Indiana Farmers Coliseum in Indianapolis, IN. You can watch the game on TruTV. Florida is a 7.5-point favorite over the Golden Eagles, according to oddsmakers.

The Numbers - Oral Roberts Golden Eagles
----------------------------------------

Oral Roberts was the ninth 15-seed to knock off a 2-seed in the tournament’s history and the first to do so since 2016. The victory was the Golden Eagles first since 1974. ORU punched their ticket to the tournament after winning the Summit League Conference Tournament as the 4-seed.

**Offensively, ORU averages 81.5 points per game** behind 45% shooting from the field and 38.7% from the three-point line. The Golden Eagles’ defense allows opponents to score 75.6 points per game on 43.2% shooting from the floor and 34.3% shooting from deep.

The **unstoppable duo of Kevin Obanor (30 points) and Max Abmas (29 points)** propelled the Golden Eagles to the overtime upset against the Buckeyes. Both players knocked down five threes apiece, and Obanor added an 11 rebound effort. ORU committed only six turnovers while forcing 16 OSU mishaps.

**ORU are 15-9 against the spread this season**, including a clean 5-0 ATS over their last five. The Golden Eagles are a perfect 4-0 ATS in neutral site games and 10-4 ATS in 14 games played on Sundays.

The Numbers - Florida Gators
----------------------------

**Florida are back in the Round of 32 for the fourth consecutive season** after knocking off the 10-seed Virginia Tech Hokies in OT. A victory Sunday puts the Gators back in the Sweet 16 for the first time since 2017 when Florida advanced to the Elite Eight. The Gators won an at-large bid into the tournament after finishing fifth in the Southeastern Conference.

**The Gators pour in 74.0 points per game** while shooting 46.8% from the field and 35.8% from beyond the arc. Florida’s defense surrenders 69.8 points per game while holding opponents to 41.1% shooting from the floor and 30.5% from three.

UF’s Colin Castleton, a junior transfer from Michigan, led the Gators with 19 points and 14 rebounds in Friday’s victory. Sophomore Scottie Lewis came off the bench to add 15 points, and junior Tre Mann added 14. The Gators shot 56.5% from the floor but turned the ball over 18 times.

**Florida are 11-13 ATS this season and 0-5 over their last five**. The Gators are 1-5 ATS in their last six games played in March and 2-3 ATS in neutral site contests.

The Pick is In
--------------

ORU looked aggressive and played with confidence in the victory over Ohio State and need to bring the same energy Sunday night if they want to be just the second 15-seed to advance to the Sweet 16. If the Gators play as they did in the second half of Friday’s opening round victory, Florida has a great shot at advancing to their school’s 12th Sweet 16. **Florida wins this one by ten and ends ORU’s cinderella run**.

The Pick: Florida Gators -7.5
