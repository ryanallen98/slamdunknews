It’s a **big-time battle** in the Big East as the Villanova Wildcats (13-2, 8-1 Big East) pay a visit to Omaha to take on the Creighton Bluejays (15-5, 11-4 Big East) inside the CHI Health Center Omaha on Saturday. Tip-off is set for 5:00 pm EST. This is the first of two matchups scheduled between the two schools, with the rematch set for March 3 in Philadelphia in what will be both programs’ penultimate regular-season affair.

Villanova Outlook
-----------------

The Wildcats will enter this Big East showdown as the 5th-ranked team in the country, falling from their perch as the No. 3 team in the land after a loss to St. John’s last Wednesday. ‘Nova responded to just their second defeat of the season with **back-to-back wins** over Georgetown and Marquette by a combined 42 points this week.

Villanova has managed to stay focused during a year that has had many stop-and-starts. They’ve had **11 cancellations or postponements** this season due to COVID concerns but still remain in first place in their conference and still have a legitimate chance at a 1-seed in the NCAA tournament.

All five of the team’s regular starters are **averaging double-figures** in points this season, led by sophomore forward Jeremiah Robinson-Earl’s 16.1 ppg. The Kansas City native has reached at least 14 points in four straight and snagged a career-high 17 rebounds in that loss to the Red Storm.

Creighton Outlook
-----------------

The Bluejays are the No.19 team in the nation, though they’ve gotten as high as 8th in the rankings, starting off the year 10-2, which **included a six-game winning streak** from December 17-January 9. Just like Villanova, Creighton has won their two most recent games, also beating Marquette and Georgetown last Saturday and this past Tuesday. Overall, they’ve won five out of their last six.

The other **similarity** between Creighton and Villanova is the fact that the Bluejays also boast five players scoring in double-digits this year. Denzel Mahoney and Marcus Zegarowski lead the way on offense and are also the team’s leader in steals and assists, respectively. However, in their most recent win over Georgetown, neither player reached double-figures as the rest of the starters stepped up in a defensive showcase over the Hoyas.

Betting Line and Pick
---------------------

**Villanova is favored by 3** in this Big East blockbuster pitting the top two teams in the conference against one another, with an over/under of 144. ‘Nova is 9-6 ATS this season and 4-1 to the number on the road. The Bluejays, meanwhile, are 8-12 ATS and 4-7 at home.

These two teams **split their two meetings** last season, but Villanova has won six out of the last eight overall.

The spotlight will be on Omaha on Saturday as this is one of only two matchups featuring both teams ranked in the Top 25. Oklahoma and West Virginia is the other, earlier in the day, so ‘Nova and Creighton will have the window to themselves on FOX. This is a potential Big East Championship preview, and we’ll have to **side with the home team**, both on Saturday and on March 3.

**Pick: Creighton +3**
