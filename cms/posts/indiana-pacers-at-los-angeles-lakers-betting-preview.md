Entering play on Friday night, there are still five teams who have yet to resume action since last weekend’s All-Star Break. Two of those teams will duel at the Staples Center when the Indiana Pacers visit the Los Angeles Lakers.

The Pacers stroll in three games below .500 but are right in the mix in the Eastern Conference. The Lakers are a **top-tier team** in the West, but newcomers like Utah and Phoenix will rival them for the #1 seed this year.

This is the first matchup between these two teams this season. The Pacers swept LA last year, becoming one of just two teams (Toronto) to **avoid a loss** to the eventual World Champions during the 2019-2020 campaign.

Let’s look at the details to determine the best play for this contest.

Indiana Pacers
--------------

Indiana begins the second half by embarking on a **difficult road stretch** around the country. In a span of four days, they will see the Lakers, Suns, and Nuggets. They then return home for one game against Brooklyn and hit the road again for two games in Miami and one in Milwaukee. This will be a tough mental test after losing five of six prior to the break.

The team is still without TJ Warren and trade acquisition Caris LeVert. While Warren is “months away” from a return, LeVert is **expected to be back** on the court at some point this month.

Malcolm Brogdon and Domantas Sabonis have **carried the load** for the Pacers. Brogdon has scored 20+ points in five of the last seven games, while Sabonis has registered at least ten points and nine or more rebounds or assists in eight of the last nine contests.

Role Players Myles Turner (27 blocks in the last eight games), TJ McConnel (recorded a triple-double with ten steals on March 4), and Doug McDermott (two 20-point games in the last two weeks) have all worked hard to contribute as well.

Los Angeles Lakers
------------------

Many of the league’s top teams appeared to really **need** the All-Star Break. The Lakers were no exception after losing six of eight leading into the break. LA should be in a good position to bounce back with seven of their next ten games against teams with sub-.500 record.

The losing stretch can be partially attributed to Anthony Davis **remaining out** with a calf injury. He has not played since February 15 but should be back this month. LeBron James is expected to return after playing just 13 minutes in the All-Star Game. Marc Gasol will miss his third straight game due to Covid protocols.

Dennis Schroder has been the **biggest beneficiary** of other players missing time. In the final four games prior to the break, the veteran guard averaged just under 20 points and six assists per game.

What to wager
-------------

The Lakers are 4.5-point favorites on Friday night, with the total set at 217. The Lakers have only won three games without Davis, but all three wins were by eight or more. The Pacers, despite their losing stretch, have managed to keep games close. The total is on the margins as well, so I will turn my attention to the **player props**.

Brogdon is pretty much the **only reliable scoring guard** for the Pacers, and I expect him to score at least 20 in a game like this. With his point total at 19.5, I’ll take the **over at -110**

**The Pick: Malcolm Brogdon over 19.5 points (-110)**
