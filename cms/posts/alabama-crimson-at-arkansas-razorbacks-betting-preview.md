It’s an **SEC showdown** on Wednesday night as No. 6 Alabama Crimson (18-5, 13-1) take on the No. 20 Arkansas Razorbacks (17-5, 9-4) at the Bud Walton Arena in Fayetteville, Arkansas.

The two teams last met on January 16th in Tuscaloosa, where Alabama won at home 90-59.

Arkansas Razorbacks Outlook
---------------------------

Everyone seems to be in agreement that these Razorbacks are not the same Razorbacks that lost 90-59 to Alabama in January. Since losing that game, the Razorbacks haven’t dropped a single SEC conference game, and on their home court, this group of Razorbacks seem unbeatable with a 13-1 home record.

Due to Covid-19 issues over at Texas A&M, the **Razorbacks haven’t played since last Tuesday**. Arkansas currently is able to boast a top-20 defensive team effort, allowing only 92 points per 100 possessions.

Prior to the postponement, **Arkansas beat an impressive Florida State team 75-64**. In that game, Freshman guard Davonte Davis led the Razorbacks with 18 points. Senior forward Justin Smith also appeared on the scoring sheet that night with 15 points.

**Moses Moody** currently leads the Razorbacks in scoring, averaging 16 points in 22 games played, shooting an average of 44% from the field and 37% from the three-point line. Second to Moody is junior guard JD Notae who is averaging 12.5 points per game in 22 games played, shooting 37.5% from the field and 32.4% from the three.

Alabama Crimson Tide Outlook
----------------------------

This particular game carries huge implications for the SEC. Alabama is currently ranked at No. 1 in the SEC, with the Razorbacks ranked at No. 2.

A road win here for Alabama would surely see them clinching the one seed from the SEC when the tournament begins in a couple of weeks.

The Crimson Tide have had what seems to be the best season of Alabama Basketball in school history.  Alabama are 8-2 in their last 10, losing two close games to No. 24 Missouri and No. 7 Oklahoma University.

In their last game, **The Crimson Tide beat Vanderbilt**, 82-78, with sophomore guard **Jaden Shackelford** getting 27 points, shooting 47% from the field. Shackelford currently leads the team in scoring with an average of 14.5 points-per-game. Sophomore guard Jahvon Quinerly followed Shackelford in scoring with 15 points against Vanderbilt, shooting 50% from the field and 50% from the three.

Betting Line and Pick
---------------------

This game is going to be a close one; as previously noted, these **Razorbacks** are not playing like the Razorbacks that lost by 31 points to **Alabama** earlier in the season. The Crimson Tide will be pulling out all the stops to try to get a win on the road in this game and secure their spot as the No. 1 seed in the SEC, while Arkansas, sitting at No.2, will be doing everything to defend their home arena and boost their SEC ranking.

With Alabama having played more time lately, their players seem to be entering the game looser and more confident than the **Razorbacks**, who were set back a week due to missing their game with Texas A&M.

The opening lines for this matchup have **Arkansas as a one-point favorite over Alabama**, with the over set at 155.5. Looking at ATS records, Alabama is 3-3-1 ATS for away games, while Arkansas is 9-4 ATS for home games.

**Pick: Alabama +1, OVER 155.5**
