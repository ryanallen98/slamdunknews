Baldwin is the first five-star prospect to commit to amid-major since Makur Maker committed to Howard last year.

Patrick Baldwin Jr., a five-star prospect in the 2021 class, announced his college decision on Wednesday, opting to play for his father, Patrick Baldwin Jr., at Milwaukee over Duke and Georgetown.

With a pledge, Baldwin, who is ranked No. 4 nationally in the 247 Sports Composite Rankings, would have propelled Duke to No. 1 in the team rankings, as well as making him the highest-rated prospect in the rankings age for Georgetown if he had chosen the Hoyas.

Instead, he'll remain in Wisconsin, where the elder Baldwin is in his fifth season as coach of the Milwaukee Bucks, with a 47-70 overall record.

Baldwin Jr., a combo forward with athletic pop who was destined to be a lottery pick, was once a candidate to be the best player in the class. He was named Gatorade Player of the Year in the state after averaging 24.3 points and 10.8 rebounds per game as a junior. However, his senior season was cut short when he suffered an ankle injury in the second game.

Because of his father's involvement with the initiative,Milwaukee emerged as a possible landing spot in the months that followed.Although Duke and others made an effort, such as Michigan, Northwestern, Georgetown, and North Carolina, it's difficult to compete when in-home recruiting visits from coaches are practically facilitated in the comfort of your own home, as Patrick Baldwin did with his son last April.

Turning down offers from blueblood schools is not uncommon among top recruits in recent years

Baldwin, on the other hand, is the first top-five prospect in his class to commit to a college programme outside of the Major 7 conference system since Tyreke Evans did so in 2008 at Memphis. The Tigers' Derrick Rose did the same the year before, and both ended up as top-five draught picks. Baldwin has long been considered a lock to be a lottery choice in 2022. Regardless of his college choice.
