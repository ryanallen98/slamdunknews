Despite Trae Young's worst shooting performance of the playoffs, the Hawks have advanced to the Eastern Conference finals. In a gruelling Game 7, Atlanta defeated the 76ers 103-96, with Young shooting just 5 for 23 from the field. Young's 21.7 percent shooting percentage was the lowest of the playoffs and the fourth lowest of the season.

‍

Despite this, he was still able to produce major plays in crucial situations. In the fourth quarter, he sank a 3-pointer from deep beyond the arc to extend the Hawks' lead to six points. From then, the Hawks were able to keep the 76ers at a safe distance.

‍

Young had a game-high 21 points and a game-high 10 assists, but Atlanta's scoring was led by Kevin Huerter. Huerter led the team with 27 points and hit 10 of 18 field goals. During Young's first-half troubles, he kept the Hawks afloat.

‍

Joel Embiid and Tobias Harris both put up great performances for the 76ers. Harris had 24 points and 14 rebounds, while Embiid had 31 points and 11 rebounds. However, the 76ers had seven more turnovers than the Hawks, and Ben Simmons (five points) was held scoreless. Sixers coach Doc Rivers suffered his fourth consecutive Game 7 loss, while Hawks coach Nate McMillan won only his third playoff series win in 12 tries.
