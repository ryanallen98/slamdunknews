In a regular-season match of the NBA 2020-21 season, the Los Angeles Lakers will face the Dallas Mavericks.

The Dallas Mavericks take on the Los Angeles Lakers in a crucial Western Conference matchup. The game is being played at the American Airlines Center, Texas (8:30 PM, April 22, local time).

Dallas is 31-26 on the season after a victory on Wednesday, while Los Angeles enters at 35-23. After a 30-game layoff, Anthony Davis (calf) is expected to return to the Lakers' line up

‍

Los Angeles Lakers power forward **Anthony Davis** said he hopes to make his return, Davis has been out since Feb. 14 with with a calf strain and Achilles tendonitis. He said he initially feared the Achilles was torn when suffering the injury.

Los Angeles' LeBron James is out due to an ankle injury, while Marc Gasol is identified as questionable due to a hand injury.

Dallas' Maxi Kleber is still out due to a back injury, and Coach Rick Carlisle said Kleber had X-Rays come back negative but has "a pretty substantial bruise" on his lower back after the win over the Pistons. 

Although Kristaps Porzingis' status will be closely monitored because the Mavericks are playing the second half of a back-to-back.

Los Angeles has alternated wins and losses in each of their last 12 games, going6-6 ATS in the process, as the backups have held the team afloat while the two stars have been sidelined.

On Wednesday, the Mavericks defeated the Detroit Pistons 127-117, defeating everyone betting on the 10.5-point gap.

**Prediction:** The Los Angeles Lakers will beat the Dallas Mavericks.
