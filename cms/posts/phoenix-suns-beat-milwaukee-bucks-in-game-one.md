Chris Paul led the Phoenix Suns to their first NBA finals berth in his 16-year career, scoring 32 points and dishing out nine assists in a 118-105 victory over the Milwaukee Bucks.

The 36-year-old point guard, who shot 12 of 19 from the field in game one, was the game's deciding factor.

‍

It's the Suns' first participation in the finals since 1993, and they're looking for their first championship.

‍

Giannis Antetokounmpo returned to the Bucks after missing two Eastern Conference games due to a hyperextended knee. In 35 minutes, he had 20 points and 17 rebounds.

‍

Paul, who stated that his teammates were looking forward to Antetokounmpo's comeback, went on to say that the Suns will not take anything for granted in the series. "One thing we are going to be is prepared for every game," he said.

‍

"We always talk about when preparation meets opportunity. We played against these guys twice.”
