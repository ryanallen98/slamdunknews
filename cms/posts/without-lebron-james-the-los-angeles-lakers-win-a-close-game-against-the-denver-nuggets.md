The Los Angeles Lakers beat the Denver Nuggets 93-89 last night at the Staples avenging a loss the previous week.

Los Angeles Lakers centre Andre Drummond (2) is guarded by Denver Nuggets centre Nikola Jokic (15) during the first quarter of the game at Staples Center on May 3, 2021.

Despite being without their two key distributors, LeBron James and Dennis Schröder, the Lakers played with renewed vigour.

Anthony Davis had his best game after returning from a right calf strain a week ago, scoring 25 points, grabbing seven rebounds, and blocking three shots.

To seal the victory, Davis came up with a crucial block on a Facundo Campazzo attempted 3-pointer at the end of the game.

‍

The Lakers, who had lost six of their previous seven games entering the game, won despite missing two main players. After suffering ankle soreness in the fourth quarter of Sunday's defeat to Toronto, LeBron James did not play in the second game of a back-to-back. Since joining the NBA's health and safety protocol, Dennis Schröder will be out for more than a week.
