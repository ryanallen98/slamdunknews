**March Madness is** at the _Lucas Oil Stadium_ and is available for live streaming access to the 2021 NCAA Tournament games. 

March Madness wasn't around for all of us in 2020, but the most remarkable event in sports history has finally made its grand return in 2021 and has done so with a huge bang. 

The 2021 NCAA Tournament has brought all the tremendous excitement we anticipated as we move closer to crowning a new national champion. 

All that's left is eight teams. And with just a few games left in the season, it's time to capture every moment of this spectacle journey. 

UCLA(21-9) has returned to the Elite Eight for the first time since 2008 under second-year coach Mick Cronin. The Bruins can make the unlikely run from First Four to Final Four, which continued with an 88-78 victory against Alabama in the Sweet 16.

Houston is also back in the game for the first time since Phi Slama Jama ruled the air.

Every game for the remainder of this NCAA Tournament will be played in a stand alone television window. The regional finals on today and tomorrow will both be aired in the evening.
