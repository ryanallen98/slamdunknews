Oregon State and Loyola Chicago will face off in the Sweet 16 to determine which team moves onto the Midwest regional final. While it was expected that this game would be between Illinois and Oklahoma State, the Ramblers and Beavers both pulled upsets to get to this point. Now, the **two Cinderella squads** will play to be a member of the Elite Eight.

The Numbers: Oregon State Beavers
---------------------------------

Oregon State has averaged 75 points per game in its first two tournament games. They have used that **consistent offensive output** to upset fifth-seeded Tennessee and fourth-seeded Oklahoma State. But their defense has been just as effective, with the Beavers allowing just 63 points per game during March Madness.

A big reason for the Beavers’ success on defense has been their **ability to rebound** the basketball. Oregon State has outrebounded Tennessee and Oklahoma State by a combined 93-66 margin through the first two rounds. That plus-27 rebounding margin has helped the Beavers limit second shots and prevent additional scoring opportunities for their opponents.

Oregon State has **also been excellent at limiting their opponents** from behind the three-point line. Tennessee and Oklahoma State shot a combined 13-55 from beyond the arc against the Beavers. Against a three-point shooting team that has been as efficient as Loyola Chicago in this tournament, Oregon State will need a similar performance to reach the Elite Eight.

The Numbers: Loyola Chicago Ramblers
------------------------------------

Loyola Chicago **may be the best defensive team** in the NCAA Tournament so far. They have defeated Georgia Tech and Illinois, who won the ACC and Big Ten respectively this postseason. The Ramblers held the Yellow Jackets to 60 points while holding the top-seeded Fighting Illini to a paltry 58 points.

But there is more to Porter Moser’s Ramblers squad than their defense. This team has been a **hyper-efficient offensive** club during the NCAA Tournament. Loyola Chicago has made half of its shots through two games, including 40% of its three-point attempts. If the Ramblers can continue their hot shooting, they could win a third straight game against a Power 5 conference champion.

The **engine for this Loyola Chicago team** is Cameron Krutwig on the inside. Krutwig has made at least half of his field-goal attempts in each of the first two games of this tournament. He was expected to be slowed down by Kofi Cockburn of Illinois but put up a 19-point, 12-rebound double-double instead. If he continues to play at this high of a level, the Ramblers could be in for another Final Four appearance.

The Pick Is In
--------------

It is undeniable that Oregon State is riding a wave of momentum at this point in time. But Loyola Chicago has stemmed the tide of momentum for several conference champions already in this tournament. Their superior defense combined with their ruthless perimeter shooting **makes the Ramblers the best possible choice** for this game. Expect Porter Moser’s team to make it back to the Elite Eight with another statement win.

**Loyola Chicago -6.5 over Oregon State**
