Two of the NBA’s best teams meet at the Staples Center on Thursday night, though **both teams will be without their best players**. The **Philadelphia 76ers** and **Los Angeles Lakers clash** for the second and final time this season.

The 76ers took the first game in Philly back on January 28. The two sides went back and forth in the final minute, trading the lead twice. **Anthony Davis** put LA ahead on a layup with 11 seconds to go, but **Tobias Harris** netted the game-winning jumper with three seconds on the clock to seal a 107-106 win for Philadelphia.

Let’s look into the state of both of these teams in late March to find the best play of the night.

Philadelphia 76ers
------------------

The **76ers have been without MVP candidate Joel Embiid for seven of the team’s last eight games**. There haven’t been many updates on his status, but the star center is just about two weeks into his initial 2-3-week diagnosis.

The **team continues to thrive regardless of who takes the court**. They have won nine of their last ten games and sit atop the Eastern Conference with a one-and-a-half game lead. The only loss in that stretch was an overtime defeat to Milwaukee.

Without Embiid, **Tobias Harris has been the team’s biggest beneficiary**. Over the last two weeks, Harris is averaging 23.0 points, 7.9 rebounds, 4.5 assists, and 2.1 steals + blocks. Four other players (in addition to Ben Simmons) are also averaging double figures during that span, including Furkan Korkmaz, who has 10+ points in seven of the last eight games.

**Seth Curry** has missed the last three games with an ankle injury and is questionable for Thursday night. **Danny Green** is also questionable with a sore left hip.

Los Angeles Lakers
------------------

All of a sudden, the **Lakers have lost three games in a row**. Even before James got hurt, it had been difficult without Davis in the lineup. The team has lost ten of its last 17 games and find themselves 4.5 games back of the top seed in the west. James (high ankle sprain) and Davis (calf) are still expected to be out for multiple weeks.

On Tuesday night against New Orleans, LA struggled to defend and struggled to score. The Lakers, who allow just 106.7 points per game (2nd in the NBA), surrendered 128 to the Pelicans. Zion Williamson and former Lakers Brandon Ingram combined to score 63 points.

Meanwhile, **none of the Lakers’ players could muster up 20 points**. The team shot just 42.4% and were down as many as 30 points in the third quarter.

What to wager
-------------

**James and Davis combined to score 57 points** (21/40 FGs) in the first matchup between these two sides. Embiid cashed in with a team-high 28. Without that star power on the floor, the dynamic of this game will shift.

The **Sixers are listed as five-point favorites with the point total set at 211.5**.

Based on the trajectories of these teams without their best players, the Sixers should really be favored by more than five points. **Take the road side before the line inevitably stretches**.

**The Pick**: Sixers -5 (-110)
