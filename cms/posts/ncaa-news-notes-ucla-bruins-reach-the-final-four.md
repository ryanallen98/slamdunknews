This is UCLA's 19th Final Four appearance in the NCAA men's tournament. 

After sneaking into the NCAA Tournament off four straight losses and barely surviving Michigan State in their First Four game, the Bruins took down top-seeded Michigan last night to continue their run!

Johnny Juzang was on his game with 28 points while playing most of the second half with a bad ankle. Coach Mick Cronin's supported bunch the team on the side-line and help them survive a set of nail-biting misses by the Wolverines in the final seconds for a 51-49 victory that made the Bruins only the fifth No. 11seed to reach the national semi-finals.

An excited Johnny Juzang said in statement: Unreal, man. Unreal. I love every single one of these guys. It's incredible, man. Surreal, surreal. Something growing up, you just dream about.", 

The hero Johnny Juzang hit just one of his two free throws with six seconds left, Michigan mustered two more clean looks trailing by two points.

The Wolverines (23-5) missed their final eight shots, including a three-pointer by senior guard Mike Smith with a only couple of seconds left on the clock and then another by Franz Wagner as he missed a shot just as the buzzer went off, sending the Bruins (22-9) flying off the bench in a wild celebration.

UCLA fans finalised the win with a dance performance of "Scoop There It Is"

The fans went on to celebrate in the streets after the men’s basketball team advanced to the Final Four for the first time since 2008.
