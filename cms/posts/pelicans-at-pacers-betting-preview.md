The New Orleans Pelicans **hit the road** for the first time in nearly two weeks when they take on the Indiana Pacers in Indianapolis on Saturday evening.

Both teams have struggled to jump-start their seasons, and each has **lost two of their last three** games. Let us find the right play in a difficult matchup to handicap.

New Orleans Pelicans
--------------------

The Pelicans have had a hard time finding their footing in year two of Zion Williamson. At 8-12, they sit **third from the bottom** in the brutally difficult Western Conference. Most of January was unkind to New Orleans. They encountered a nine-game stretch where they suffered **eight losses**.

Williamson and Brandon Ingram have both been outstanding, but there is little in the way of **support** for them at the moment.

Lonzo Ball has been mediocre at best, averaging 12.9 points, 4.6 assists, and 3.9 rebounds per game. At just 13.8 points and 3.7 assists per game, Eric Bledsoe has not been an adequate replacement for Jrue Holiday. It is clear that they miss Holiday and **lack depth**.

Indiana Pacers
--------------

The Pacers are still in transition after the blockbuster trade that sent James Harden to the Nets, Victor Oladipo to the Rockets, and Caris LeVert to Indiana. LeVert has **not played since being traded**. During his physical, upon arrival, doctors found a small mass on his kidney, and LeVert had it successfully removed last week. Though he is expected to make a full recovery, there is no timetable for his return.

Without LeVert and “Bubble MVP” TJ Warren (surgery/stress fracture) out indefinitely, both Domantas Sabonis and Malcolm Brogdon have been forced to **carry extra weight** on their shoulders.

Brogdon is averaging a career-high 22.4 PPG. That is nearly a full six points more than the previous career-best he hit last season. Sabonis has collected a **double-double in 20 out of 22 games** so far this year and is well on his way to being named an All-Star for the second straight year.

What to wager
-------------

Neither team has been particularly **stout defensively**. Both teams allow just over 112 PPG, which puts them 18th and 20th in the league, respectively.

The blueprint for success will be written on the glass. Despite Sabonis’ stellar rebounding numbers, he needs help. The Pacers are the third-worst rebounding team in the league, while the **Pelicans rank fourth from the top** in that category. In addition, only three teams are better at preventing offensive rebounds than New Orleans. They clean the glass exceptionally well on defense.

Since both teams are so erratic when it comes to wins and losses, it is **best to stay away** from any point spreads or money lines. The total is where we will focus for this one.

Not only are these two bottom-half defenses, but they are also two teams who get the majority of their points from efficient areas. Both teams are top seven (and the Pacers are #1) in the league in points in the paint. Those **two factors combined** are enough to make me lean towards the over on the reasonable total of 226.5.

**The Pick: Over 226.5**
