Few players have ever reached the heights of Kevin Durant's 49-point, triple-double performance against the Bucks in the playoffs.

‍

Durant topped Vince Carter's 2006 mark of 43 points in a playoff game to set a franchise record for points in a playoff game. He also recorded his second career postseason triple-double, joining Oscar Robertson, Charles Barkley, and Dallas Mavericks forward Luka Doncic as the fourth player in playoffs history to score at least 40 points, 15 rebounds, and 10 assists.

‍

Durant scored 31 points in the final 18:38 of Tuesday's game, as the Nets defeated Milwaukee 54-32. He scored 11 points in the third quarter to pull Brooklyn within 87-81 heading into the fourth, and a three-pointer with 7:54 left gave the Nets a 97-96 lead.

‍

The Nets have a 3-2 lead in the best-of-seven series after overturning a 17-point third-quarter deficit thanks to one of Durant's most remarkable playoffs efforts. If they win in Milwaukee on Thursday night, they will reach their first Eastern Conference finals since 2003. If required, Game 7 will be played on Saturday in Brooklyn.
