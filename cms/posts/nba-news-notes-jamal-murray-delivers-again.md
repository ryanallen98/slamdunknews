It was an **exciting Friday night in the NBA**. As March Madness produced several overtime games and magical moments, the NBA continued to do what it does best, and that brings greatness into all of our living rooms. Let’s start in Denver.

Jamal Murray’s Heroics Lead Denver to OT Win
--------------------------------------------

**The Bulls have proven to be a tough out for most teams this year**. Denver included. But, with the team down by three and just three seconds left, Jamal Murray came through. He got the ball to the corner, put up a beautiful fake, and that fired it up. Murray cashed the triple with just 0.4 seconds left on the clock to tie the game and send it to OT.

**Denver came through in the extra session**, as Murray and Nikola Jokic did enough to help lift the team to a 25-16 record. Jokic finished the way with 34-15-9, while Murray had 34 points and five assists. Facundo Campazzo dished out eight assists off the team’s bench.

This is a tough loss for Chicago, who came so close to improving to 19-21. **Zach LaVine** scored 32, while Otto Porter added 22 off the bench in the loss.

Cavs Comeback Against Spurs Falls Short
---------------------------------------

After falling behind to the Spurs by 22 points late in the third quarter, it seemed like just another blowout loss for the team. But that isn’t what happened at all. **Lamar Stevens** entered the game and immediately revitalized the entire team. In just 17 minutes on the court, he amassed career-highs of 15 points and 11 rebounds, **marking the first double-double of his career**.

**Brodric Thomas** didn’t see the bench again once he first checked in, and he added seven points and a number of key assists and defensive plays. Dean Wade got his first taste of minutes as an NBA center and was able to hold his own. Darius Garland poured in a career-high of 29 points, and the team lost by just six.

A loss is a loss, but the Cavs rallied with a lot of backups on the court. It **showed their resiliency** and that the rebuild is trending in the right direction.

Keldon Johnson Goes for 20 and 20
---------------------------------

**In the same game that the Cavs lost, there was another big milestone**. 20-20 games in the NBA are hard to come by. Scoring 20 points isn’t as hard as it used to be. But grabbing 20 rebounds is incredibly difficult. Especially if you’re 6-5 like **Keldon Johnson** is. Well, on Friday night, it appeared he was quite literally larger than life (and all the defenders).

**Keldon grabbed 21 rebounds (11 offensive) in 39 minutes of action**. Jakob Poeltl’s first-half foul trouble forced Johnson into some extra minutes, and he took full advantage. He became the first Spurs player since Tim Duncan in 2013 to have a game with 20 points and 20 rebounds. Johnson has had some great games this year, as he continues to show the league what he’s capable of.

San Antonio also got 20 points, and seven assists from **DeMar DeRozan**, and 22 points from **Dejounte Murray** in the win.
