The game will take place at the Capital One Arena in Washington, DC, on Wednesday at 7:30p.m. EST (5:00 a.m. IST). Alex Caruso is still on the shelf, though Jared Dudley is already out.

According to recent NBA reports, the legend of the Los Angeles Lakers will not play in the game against the Washington Wizards.

James is on the verge of missing the rest of the regular season. The Los Angeles Lakers have yet to provide an estimated return date for the NBA's best player, still out with a high ankle sprain.

Although there are few details on James's exact return date, Denis Schroder recently discussed his return, which could be sooner than many people believe.

"I mean, he's close, "Schroder said, according to The Athletic's Jovan Buha. "I can tell you that much. We're ready. We can't wait for him to get back to help us win games again and be together at the right time. Eleven games in and get to work".
