It’s a Big 12 Conference matchup on Tuesday night as the ranked No. 17 Kansas Jayhawks (17-7, 11-5) take on the ranked No. 14 Texas Longhorns (13-6, 7-5) in the Frank Erwin Special Events Center in Austin.

The two teams last met on January 2nd, when the Longhorns traveled to Kansas and won 84-59. Tip-off is at 9:00 P.M. Eastern.

Kansas Jayhawks Outlook
-----------------------

The Jayhawks are riding high on a five-game win streak, defeating most recently No. 15 Texas Tech on Saturday at home in Lawrence. With only two games left to play in the regular season, the Jayhawks will be looking to finish strong against a challenging schedule when they face both the Longhorns and No. 2 in Baylor.

Kansas is 4-5 in road games, while the Longhorns are 7-5 at home. A statement road win against a ranked opponent would be a huge resume-booster

In the 67-61 victory over Texas Tech, sophomore David McCormack scored 17 points in 35 minutes. McCormack shot 70% from the field and 100% from the free-throw line. However, last time out against the Longhorns, McCormack was scoreless from the floor and picked up eight points from the charity stripe.

McCormack is second on the team in points per game (13.0) this season. He trails Ochai Agbaji (13.6), who is one of five Kansas players to average double-digit points per game.

Texas Longhorns Outlook
-----------------------

The Longhorns have struggled as of late, winning only two of their last six. While the losses have piled up for the Longhorns, frustrations on the team seem to be bubbling to the surface. Going 5-5 in their last 10 games, the Longhorns need to right the ship at home before closing the regular season out at Texas Tech.

Texas has struggled at home against No. 2 Baylor, No. 9 Oklahoma, and, most recently, No. 13 West Virginia.

In Saturday’s collapse against West Virginia, Longhorns leading scorers Courtney Ramey and Andrew Jones got into a fight during a timeout. Both had to be restrained by other players and coaching staff. Texas was outscored 34-18 and lost the game 84-82.

In that game, Ramey had 28 points in 28 minutes played, while Jones had nine points in 35 minutes played with three assists and eight rebounds.

Betting Line and Pick
---------------------

Texas is favored by 1.5 in this Big 12 battle, with the over/under set at 139.5. With both teams capable of lighting up a scoreboard, this will be a fantastic game to watch.

While the predictions put Texas ahead, our play is leaning in the opposite direction. The Jayhawks are playing their best basketball of the season currently, with renewed confidence and players playing on both sides of the court with ease. On the other hand, the Longhorns are trending downward, losing games in the final minutes and struggling with inter-team strife.

Expect Kansas to take one on the road and walk away with the W.

**Betting Pick: Kansas Jayhawks (+1.5), OVER 139.5**
