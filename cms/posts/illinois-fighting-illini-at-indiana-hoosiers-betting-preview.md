A key Big Ten matchup is set to take place in Bloomington, Ind., on Tuesday night as the No. 12 Illinois Fighting Illini travel to take on the Indiana Hoosiers at Assembly Hall. The Fighting Illini are coming off an impressive win on Friday against then-No. 7 Iowa, winning 80-75. The Hoosiers haven't played a game in nearly 10 days, with their most recent contest being a loss to Rutgers on Jan. 24.

As the calendar turns another month and the number of games starts to dwindle, the importance of every contest increases. Indiana is riding the bubble line in college hoops and sitting in that 11 to 13 seed range. A win over Illinois and Iowa (who the Hoosiers face this weekend) in the same week could help solidify their chances of getting in.

Sitting Idle
------------

After upsetting Iowa on the road a little over a week ago, the Hoosiers quickly lost all momentum in losing to Rutgers 74-70 at home. They now sit at 9-7 overall and 4-5 in league play for eighth in Big Ten standings.

With roughly only a month left in the regular season, they need to find a way to turn things around and get off the NCAA bubble line. Indiana still has plenty of chances to pick up those big wins, as the rest of its schedule in the Big Ten features six of 10 games coming up against Top 25 teams.

Due to the Michigan athletic department struggling with COVID-19, Indiana has had to wait nine days since it last played a basketball game. The Hoosiers can almost look at it as a blessing as they trend towards getting their roster back to healthy.

Sophomore guard Armaan Franklin has been battling an ankle injury of late, re-aggravating it against Rutgers. In the first meeting with Illinois, he scored 23 points on 67% shooting from the field. Indiana is going to need him ready to go if it wants a chance at pulling an upset.

Flying High
-----------

The Illini have an overall record of 11-5 and a Big Ten record of 7-3. This team has been wildly inconsistent this season, dropping a game to Maryland early in January, which you could argue is the only bad loss on its resume.

However, the Illini picked up a huge win over Iowa on Friday and found themselves back in the hunt for a Big Ten title and a Top 25 ranking.

Illinois is led by the duo of big man Kofi Cockburn and guard Ayo Dosunmu. Dosunmu leads the team in scoring at 21.9 points, 6.1 rebounds, and 4.8 assists per game, while Cockburn is putting a double-double of 17 points and 10 rebounds.

The last time the Hoosiers and Illinois met, Indiana was able to hold Dosunmu in check for much of the game. But in the last eight minutes of the game, the All-American and national player of the year candidate took the game over.

The Illini are going to have to do a much better job on the defensive end of the court in this one than they have most of the year. The Big Ten is loaded with skilled teams, so the effort and energy is going to need to be there right from the tip.

Betting Lines and Pick
----------------------

Bookmakers have Illinois as the 2.5-point home favorite. The Hoosiers and Fighting Illini have already met once this season, with Illinois winning at home, 69-60.

That game was much closer than the final score shows, with the Hoosiers leading with seven minutes left in the game. But Dosunmu scored 18 points in the final stanza to help the Illini pull away.

On the year, Illinois is averaging 82.7 points per game as a team while Indiana sits at 72.9 points, which is nearly a 10-point differential in scoring outputs. Illinois is one of the better offensive teams in the country, making right around 50% of its field-goal attempts. But the team has been exceptional from deep, leading the conference in three-point percentage at 40%.

The Hoosiers are going to need a total team effort to pull out this game. Defending the three-point line has been a real issue all year, so I expect this to be a part of the defensive strategy against the conference's best three-point shooting team.

In the Iowa win, Indiana held the Hawkeyes to 5-of-23 shooting from deep. The Hoosiers are going to need to run the Orange and Blue off the three-point line if they are hoping to replicate that success again.
