Strap in for some late-night Pac-12 action as the Stanford Cardinal (14-11, 10-9 Pac-12) are in Los Angeles for a **critical matchup** with the USC Trojans (19-6, 13-5 Pac-12) on Wednesday night. Tip-off from the Galen Center is set for 10:30pm EST. This is the second meeting of the regular season between the two programs after two other scheduled attempts were postponed due to COVID concerns. USC won the first matchup back on February 2, rallying in the second half to win by six.

Stanford Outlook
----------------

The Cardinal have **dropped three in a row** to fall out of the field of 68, according to most projections. The skid began with a three-overtime loss to Washington State two weeks ago, and they weren’t able to recover in losses to Oregon and Oregon State. Prior to the current slide, Stanford was firmly on the bubble and could have made a case as the fifth Pac-12 representative in the NCAA Tournament.

Instead, they’ll close out their regular-season slate with a **must-win** against the Trojans and then hope for the best in the conference tournament.

The Cardinal hope to have Oscar da Silva for their **most important game of the year**. The senior forward leads the team and is second in the conference in scoring at 18.8 ppg, notching double-figures in all but one game this season. However, he has missed the last two games with a foot injury.

USC Outlook
-----------

As of now, the Trojans are in the Big Dance, projected anywhere from a 5-7 seed. However, they have **dropped two in a row themselves** and now sit a half-game back of UCLA, tied with Oregon for second place in the Pac-12.

USC has slipped as of late, losing three of their last four after building win streaks of six and seven games in two separate stretches. The Trojans still have one game remaining after the Wednesday night matchup with Stanford, a **huge tilt** with the Bruins on Saturday at Pauley Pavilion.

Evan Mobley **leads the team** in four major statistical categories, including points, and is a frontrunner for Pac-12 Defensive Player of the Year, leading the conference in rebounds and blocks.

Betting Line and Pick
---------------------

USC is favored by 7.5 points in this Pac-12 showdown, with an over/under of 137. The Trojans covered as 3-point favorites in the first meeting with the 138 combined points just going OVER the posted total by a single point. The Trojans are an impressive 15-10 ATS this season, including 9-5 at home. Stanford, meanwhile, is 12-12-1 and 5-6 ATS on the road.

Once again, the look-ahead factor is very much in play in this game. USC and UCLA could be the most important game of the year in the Pac-12 on Saturday, but Stanford is in dire straits with this being their season finale. Be sure to monitor da Silva’s status. If he doesn’t play, this number could go even higher, but in any event, we expect **Stanford to throw the kitchen sink at USC**, and we’ll gladly take the points.

**Pick: Stanford +7.5**
