The Chicago Bulls rallied against the Boston Celtics for a 128-114 road win on Monday night, led by DeMar DeRozan's 37 points on 15-of-20 shooting and seven rebounds. Zach LaVine added 26 points and seven assists.

 

The Celtics led by as much as 19 points late in the third quarter before the Bulls rallied for a 106-105 victory on Ayo Dosunmu's three-pointer with 6:54 remaining. In the fourth quarter, Chicago outscored Boston 39-11.

 

For the Bulls, Dosunmu had 14 points, Lonzo Ball had 12, and Nikola Vucevic had 11 points, 10 rebounds, and nine assists in their sixth win in seven games to start the season.

 

The Celtics were led by Jaylen Brown, who had 28 points and seven rebounds. For Boston, Jayson Tatum had 20 points, Al Horford had 20 points and 10 rebounds, and Marcus Smart had 16 points. Brown and Tatum were then chastised by Smart for not passing the ball sufficiently.
