The Denver Nuggets begin a four-game road trip out east when they visit the Boston Celtics on Tuesday night. This is the **first meeting** between these teams this season.

The Nuggets enter their road trip at a respectable 15-11, but a competitive Western Conference puts them seventh in the standings. The Celtics are **struggling** to find solid ground, but they remain fifth in the East at 13-13.

Let’s take a look at what this matchup has in store to find the best bets.

Boston Celtics
--------------

The 7-3 start for the Celtics provided hope for a successful season, and then **Covid came crashing in**. Jayson Tatum tested positive, the team had to postpone three games, and they are now 5-10 over the last month.

Tatum has maintained a high volume of production, but his averages and consistency have **clearly come down** since his bout with Covid. He is now averaging under 20 points per game and shooting just 34.8% from the field over the last four games. His most recent outing in Washington (6 points, 3/14 FGs) was his lowest point total in a game since his five-point bubble debut against Milwaukee.

Kemba Walker is doing his best to **establish** himself as a third scoring threat. After just two 20+ point efforts in his first ten games this season, Walker has scored 21 and 25 in the last two he has played. Those numbers coincide with season-low assist totals, so he may be adjusting his mindset, going back to vintage-scoring Kemba.

Denver Nuggets
--------------

The start of the season for Denver was less stable than expected. After going 6-7 in their first 13 games, things have **balanced** themselves out thanks to Nikola Jokic’s MVP-caliber play. A five-game win streak put them on the right side of .500. After dropping three straight in early February, they are back on track with three wins in a row.

The Nuggets are dealing with some **injury troubles**. They will be without Paul Milsap, who sprained his knee on Sunday night against the Lakers. Will Barton (Personal Reasons), Gary Harris (Thigh), and PJ Dozier (Hamstring) are also out on Tuesday night, while Monte Morris (Shoulder) is questionable.

As long as Jokic (double or triple-double in all but one game this year) and Jamal Murray (47 points over the last two games) are **healthy**, the Nuggets will have their two best on the floor.

What to wager
-------------

It is hard to ask these teams’ superstars to do even more on any given night, but that is exactly what **needs to happen** to find a winner in this matchup.

The Nuggets’ only three-game losing streak this season came just over a week ago. In the second and third losses, Jokic has two of his **best scoring nights**, netting 50 and 35.

Despite their injuries, **Denver is the team to beat** here, so I don’t see anything wrong with banking the Nuggets as three-point underdogs. Taking +120 on the moneyline or an alternate -3.5 at +170 are both fine plays as well.

With Milsap out, Jokic will take the reigns from a scoring perspective. Boston has struggled to defend quality size, so I like **Jokic to hit his point total** of 24.5.

‍

**The Picks: Jokic over 24.5 points (-110, full unit) & Nuggets -3.5 (+170, half unit)**
