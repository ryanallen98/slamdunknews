We have a heavyweight bout of two top 10 teams set to take place as the No. 7 Ohio State Buckeyes travel to take on the No. 8 Iowa Hawkeyes in a Big Ten battle on Thursday.

Ohio State is one the best teams in the country right now, winning three straight matchups heading into this game. The Hawkeyes have struggled of late, losing two in a row before bouncing back with a win on Tuesday over Michigan State.

This is the kind of game Iowa needs for a chance to regain some momentum after dropping in the national rankings on Monday.

Buckeyes Are Hot
----------------

The Ohio State Buckeyes are on a roll of late and continue to play great basketball across the board. They have won six of their last seven games, with their last matchup being a blowout over Michigan State, 79-62, on Sunday.

Defense continues to be a major point of emphasis, as the Buckeyes have been making it difficult for opposing offenses. This is due to great coaching and their talented length and high-intensity style of play.

Great offense of late has fueled the Buckeyes' recent run. As a team, they shoot only 45.4% from the field and 34.3% from the three point line. The Buckeyes do a great job playing you inside/out.

One Game At A Time
------------------

The Hawkeyes have run into a bit of trouble of late, dropping two of their last three games. The losses dropped them to third in the Big Ten standings, but they hope their win over Michigan State can get them back headed in the right direction.

There is no disputing that the Big Ten has been arguably the best conference in all of college basketball this season. The Buckeyes and Hawkeyes both come in separated by one game in the standings.

With the Michigan athletics program being shut down for a stretch of time with the Wolverines sitting comfortably at 8-1, these big games count if these two teams want a shot at the conference title.

Betting Lines and Pick
----------------------

The Hawkeyes are five-point home favorites. Thanks to their most recent win, the Hawkeyes should feel some of that pressure start to slowly slip away despite dropping two of their last three. This is an extremely talented group, with some of the best shooters in the country and the nation's top big man.

With some quality Big Ten wins, the Buckeyes have shocked many in their ascension to the No. 7 spot in the national rankings. The offense has played extremely well of late, and this group matches up pretty evenly with the Hawkeyes.

I would give the slight edge to the Hawkeyes in this matchup, even considering how well Ohio State has played in its last seven games. Senior big man Luka Garza, who is averaging 26.4 points and 8.6 rebounds, will be the key in this one as he proves too much for sophomore forward E.J. Liddell.

Free Betting Pick: Iowa -5
