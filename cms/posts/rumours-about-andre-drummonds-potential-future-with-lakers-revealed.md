After being bought out by the Cleveland Cavaliers in the middle of the season, the Los Angeles Lakers signed veteran centre Andre Drummond. The transaction appeared incredibly perplexing at the time. After all, the Lakers also had Marc Gasol, Montrezl Harrell, and Anthony Davis, so Drummond's addition was a bit of a surprise.

According to ESPN's Dave McMenamin, the Lakers may have bigger plans for Drummond than a one-year rental before he hits the free-agent market in the summer.

This, at the very least, is interesting. Davis and Drummond have had a tumultuous relationship. It has worked well at times and not so well at others. Another important point to consider is that the Lakers are facing financial difficulties this summer.

The Lakers have a lot of decisions to make, most notably with Talen Horton-Tucker, so re-signing Drummond isn't exactly logical, especially if he wants a big salary. The Lakers would have to rely on the MLE to keep Drummond, and it's unclear whether he'd take that money or pursue a bigger, potentially max deal in the offseason.

To say the least, this summer in Los Angeles will be interesting.
