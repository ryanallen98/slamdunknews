The Denver Nuggets travel up to Wisconsin on Tuesday night for a matchup with the Milwaukee Bucks. The Nuggets are on the back-end of a Midwest back-to-back after a **tight win** in Chicago on Monday. The Bucks are riding a five-game win streak after an impressive Sunday afternoon win against the Clippers.

This is the **second meeting** between the two teams this year after Milwaukee grabbed a 125-112 win in Denver on February 9. The game was tied at 86 in the third quarter before the Bucks pulled away in the fourth. All five Milwaukee starters scored in double figures, led by Giannis Antetokounmpo’s 30 and Khris Middleton’s 29.

Let’s take a peek at Round Two between these two sides to find the **best bet** for this one.

Denver Nuggets
--------------

Denver’s record of 19-15 is not a great indicator of how they have played this season. This team was arguably the “Bubble Darling” when they advanced to the Western Conference Finals back in August. The numbers this year dictate that they are **once again a top-five offense** and 11th in defense.

Entering Tuesday, the Nuggets are in the **#7 spot in the West**. They are a game-and-a-half back of the #5 seed but only two games up on tenth place Memphis.

The team was **shorthanded in Chicago**, missing three players due to injury and three more due to COVID protocol. Gary Harris (thigh), JaMychal Green (shoulder), and Paul Milsap (knee) are all likely to miss at least the final two games before the All-Star Break. RJ Hampton, Facundo Campazzo, and Markus Howard are all in the league’s Health and Safety Protocol.

Milwaukee Bucks
---------------

The Bucks seemed to like their **streaks in fives** in February. They began the month with five straight wins. The middle of the month brought a five-game losing streak, but the final five games provided five wins against Western Conference opponents.

Antetokounmpo has **led the team** in points and rebounds in 20 of the last 21 games, including each of the last 14. The Greek Freak also has four straight games with 36 or more points in a row during the current winning streak.

Milwaukee is also happy to see Jrue Holiday **back on the floor** after missing ten games due to COVID protocols. The former All-Star came off the bench on Sunday against the Clippers, and it may take him a few games to get back to full strength. With Holiday back, the team is completely healthy heading into Tuesday night’s game.

What to wager
-------------

The Bucks were likely to be **favored by a handful** of points. With Denver playing the second game of a back-to-back and missing six players, Milwaukee is a seven-point favorite with the over / under set at 236.

I expect the **Bucks to take care of business at home** against the banged-up Nuggets. The team has really settled into a groove since returning to Milwaukee. This is the final game of an eight-game homestand, and they will look to close it out with a convincing win.

**The Pick: Bucks -7 (-110)**
