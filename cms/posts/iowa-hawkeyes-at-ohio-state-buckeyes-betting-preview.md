It's a **Big Ten showdown** on Sunday afternoon as the No. 9 Iowa Hawkeyes (17-7, 11-6) take on the No. 4 Ohio State Buckeyes (18-6, 12-6) at the Value City Arena in Columbus, Ohio. Tip-off is set for 4:00 PM EST.

The last time these two met was on February 4th, 2021, in which the **Buckeyes** won 89-85.

Iowa Hawkeyes Outlook
---------------------

The **Hawkeyes** four-game winning streak was dashed by Michigan earlier this week in Ann Arbor when the Wolverines defeated the Hawkeyes 79-57.

Iowa opened that game on a good note, shooting 40% in the first half and having **strong showings by CJ Frederick and Jordan Bohannon**, who combined collected 18 of Iowa'sIowa's 29 points in the first half. Their defensive showing in the first was strong, too, holding Michigan to only 32 points, but by the second half, it all fell apart, and Michigan dominated the game.

**Hawkeyes star Luka Garza struggled** against a stalwart Michigan defense and only came away with 16 points. For Iowa to get a rebound win on the road against a solid Ohio State team, the Hawkeyes shooters must turn the ship around and prove once again that they can play with the top of the top in NCAA basketball.

A testament road win here for the **Iowa Hawkeyes** would see their ranking get a needed last-minute boost as they head into the NCAA tournament; it is officially crunch time for both teams with only three left to play.

Ohio State Buckeyes Outlook
---------------------------

**Ohio State** has a high-powered offense that is supported mainly by two players: EJ Liddell and Duane Washington. Liddell is averaging 16 points-per-game and 6.8 rebounds, while Washington is averaging 15.6 points-per-game and two rebounds.

Throughout the season, the **Buckeyes** have trailed Iowa in offensive efficiency, but with the blowout loss of Iowa to Michigan earlier this week, the trend might be starting to head in the Buckeyes direction. Important to note, however, in the Buckeyes' most recent game against Michigan State, they lost 71-67.

The Buckeyes will be looking to get a solid home win here against the Hawkeyes to improve their ranking as we go into the **NCAA tournament**. At this point in the season, every top Big 10 game has massive implications for the seeding, especially with Ohio State sitting at No. 4 and the Hawkeyes having dropped to No. 9.

Betting Line and Pick
---------------------

**The Buckeyes are going into Sunday's matchup as one-point favorites**. The Over/Under is set at 160.

**While Ohio State is favored in this matchup, the Hawkeyes have played an amazing season** and have proven that they can take down some of the biggest teams in the Big 10.

We fully **expect this to be a close affair** that will ultimately come down to shooting efficiency, and with the Hawkeyes eeking out Ohio State in the stats; 47% field goal shooting compared to 46%, 40% three-point shooting compared to 36%, we are trending towards taking the Hawkeyes in this matchup.

PICK: Iowa Hawkeyes -1.50 Points
