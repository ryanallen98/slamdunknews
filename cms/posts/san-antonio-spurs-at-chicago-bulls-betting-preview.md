The Chicago Bulls and San Antonio Spurs meet for the first of two games in a ten-day span on Wednesday night. This matchup will be at the United Center, while next Sunday’s will take place in San Antonio.

In their only meeting last season, the Bulls **pulled out a narrow 110-109 victory** thanks to 13 fourth-quarter points from Zach LaVine. Down 108-110, DeMar DeRozan got fouled with 0.2 seconds remaining but could not convert on the second of his two free throws, handing Chicago the win.

Let’s look at how these sides stack up for Wednesday night’s battle and find the best bet of the night.

San Antonio Spurs
-----------------

At 20-16, the new-look Spurs **continue to win** most of the games they are expected to win, even after their February Covid outbreak. They are 4-5 since the outbreak and 2-2 after the All-Star Break.

The team continues to **operate without DeRozan** for the time being. The 31-year-old will miss his fourth game following the death of his father. The team also agreed to part ways with LaMarcus Aldridge last week, so there are a lot of minutes to be filled.

Rather than one player filling the void, Gregg Popovich has **spread the minutes** across all of his players. Drew Eubanks (17.3 MPG) has seen the largest uptick in playing time. Five other players have seen 2-5 minute increases over the last week.

The balance of the team is evident by who leads the scoring charge each night. The Spurs have had **five different leading scorers** in the last six games. It is a microcosm of their season, as ten different players have paced the team in scoring in a game this year.

Chicago Bulls
-------------

The Bulls are winners of two straight after dropping four of their previous five games. The schedule is about to **get very difficult** for Chicago. We have covered their successes against the bad teams and failures against the good ones. As long as that recent trend holds, it is worth repeating.

With their blowout win over Oklahoma City on Tuesday night, the Bulls have now **won nine consecutive games** against teams below .500. They have also lost six straight against teams over .500.

The Spurs are the first of what will be **eight of the next ten games against teams at or above .500**. That slate includes Denver, Utah (twice), Phoenix, and Brooklyn. A variable gauntlet of opponents.

They come in ninth in the East at the moment, a game-and-a-half out of the newly coveted #6 spot and a game-and-a-half up on the newly #11 spot.

What to wager
-------------

The Bulls are **favored by a single point** on Wednesday night. Chicago is on the second game of a back-to-back and the final game of their five-game homestand. They will be almost fully healthy, with Garrett Temple’s sprained ankle as the lone exception.

Without DeRozan, the 2-1 record for San Antonio can be misleading. The two wins came against Orlando and Detroit, the two worst teams in the East (and two of the four worst teams in the NBA).

I expect the **Bulls to keep their momentum** before their schedule hits a higher gear later in the week. Take the Bulls.

**The Pick: Bulls -1 (-110)**
