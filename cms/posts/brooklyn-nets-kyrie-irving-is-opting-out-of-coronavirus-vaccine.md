Brooklyn Nets, Kyrie Irving is opting out of coronavirus vaccine

 

The Brooklyn Nets' star has opted out of the coronavirus vaccine and may have to play a shorter NBA schedule as a result. 

 

The NBA does not require players to get vaccinated, but New York City has a policy prohibiting athletes from practising or playing in games within city limits; Irving is a vice president on the NBA Players' Union's executive committee.

 

Kyrie Irving of the Brooklyn Nets has stated that he does not want to receive the Covid-19 vaccination, and his aunt has urged that the NBA form an agreement with anti-vaccine athletes that would allow them to participate in fewer games.

 

Irving has yet to receive his first covid Jab. 

 

The NBA does not require players to get vaccinated, but New York City has a rule that prohibits athletes from practising or participating in games within city limits.

 

According to Rolling Stone, between 50 to 60 NBA players have failed to receive their first dosage of coronavirus vaccine.
