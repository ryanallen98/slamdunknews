The **Los Angeles Lakers make their only trip to The Big Easy on Tuesday night when they face the New Orleans Pelicans**. The Lakers, who are 3.5 games back of the top seed in the west, will be without LeBron James and former Pelican Anthony Davis.

This is the second matchup between the two sides this year. The Lakers handled the first game with ease back in January. New Orleans held the lead early in the second half, but LA stretched a lead of their own to 25 in the fourth to put the game away.

Let’s find the best value play for this intriguing matchup.

Los Angeles Lakers
------------------

Back when these teams last met, James, Davis, and Marc Gasol all started. **All three of them are likely to miss Tuesday’s game**. James (high ankle sprain) and Davis (calf) are expected out for multiple weeks, while Gasol (conditioning) is hoping for a quicker return following a stint in the NBA’s Health and Safety protocols.

**James got hurt on Saturday against Atlanta** after playing just 11 minutes. The Lakers lost that game and Sunday’s contest in Phoenix as well. It will be a difficult sprint to the finish line for LA with the Clippers, Nuggets, and Blazers breathing down their neck in the standings. A string of losses could place them outside the top four for the playoffs.

In the absence of their superstars, **Montrezl Harrell** has paced the team in scoring for two straight nights. The six-year vet now has five games of 23+ points over the team’s last seven. It is by far the best run of high-volume scoring in the big man’s career.

New Orleans Pelicans
--------------------

**New Orleans enter with a record of 18-24**. They are three games back of the final play-in spot in the west. The team is a modest 3-3 since the All-Star Break, and the results speak to their inconsistencies this year.

**They began with a loss to the worst team in the league, Minnesota, before beating Cleveland**. The Pelicans used that momentum to grab a second win by beating the Clippers. Two straight losses to the Blazers in Portland preceded a hard-fought win in Denver.

**New Orleans has been beating good teams and losing to mediocre ones all season**. They have wins over Milwaukee, Phoenix, and Utah … But have suffered humiliating defeats to Minnesota (twice), Houston and Detroit.

**Lonzo Ball**, who missed Sunday’s game in Denver, is questionable for Tuesday night. JJ Redick will miss his eighth straight game with inflammation in his right heel.

What to wager
-------------

It is no surprise that the **Pelicans are 6.5-point favorites**. The Lakers are severely undermanned. The spread and point total both reflect that with the over / under set at 223.

The **Lakers were hitting well below the point total prior to LeBron getting hurt**. They have gone under 221 in each of the last three games, and in the two games (sans 11 minutes) without LeBron, the totals fell on 193 and 205.

**New Orleans are a high-scoring side at 115.3 points per game**, good for fifth in the league. They also give up the sixth-most points per game, so there is too much juxtaposition and too many injuries to bet the total or spread.

**Dennis Schroeder** has been remarkably consistent despite the hurricane of players that surrounds him. He has taken on the responsibility with LeBron and AD out, and I like him to go over both his point total (18.5) and 3-pointers made total (1.5).

**The Pick**: Dennis Schroeder over 18.5 points (-118) and over 1.5 threes (+125)
