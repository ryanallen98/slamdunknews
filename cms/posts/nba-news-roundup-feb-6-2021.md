Friday Night was another eventful night in the NBA, with COVID-19 chaos, clutch buzzer-beaters, and offensive outbursts.

Here are the top stories you need to know following Friday night's NBA action.

What on Earth Happened with Kevin Durant?
-----------------------------------------

Friday started as just another day for Kevin Durant. He had basketball on his mind, and the Nets looked forward to having him play against Toronto. But it wasn’t as simple as that. Durant contracted COVID-19 in March and has the antibodies. However, he was around somebody that might have had the virus earlier in the day.

That person was awaiting test results, and Durant was told he wouldn’t be available for the game until they had those results. A few minutes into the Nets-Raptors game, Durant got the notice that he was allowed to play, and that’s what he did for much of the first half. This was the first time he came off the bench in his long career.

However, early in the third quarter, those results from the person Durant was in contact with came back positive. The league had allowed him to play while they waited, which could jeopardize many things and is a bad look for the NBA, in retrospect.

Durant was told he had to leave not only the game but the arena too. He tweeted “Free Me” shortly after all of this, clearly not happy with the situation.

The NBA has been pretty good about making sure protocol is present, and rules are enforced. But this one doesn’t make a whole lot of sense. However the league decides to handle things moving forward, it hopefully won’t have any lingering effects.

LaMelo Ball Explodes Against Utah
---------------------------------

There are always plusses and minuses with every game played in this league. On the downside, Charlotte allowed the Jazz to score 138 points last night, their defense nonexistent. But on the bright side, we finally got to see LaMelo play alongside the duo of Devonte Graham and Terry Rozier, though Graham exited early.

Ball put up an incredible statline and was not shy at all, shooting it 27 times. Ball finished with 34 points (14-27 FG), four rebounds, eight assists, two steals, and a block. His net rating in a 17-point loss was just -1, and he didn’t commit a single turnover. This game marks the first time in his young career that he didn’t register a turnover.

The hype was there for Lonzo Ball, and it’s much higher for LaMelo. A superstar is budding in Charlotte.

D’Angelo Russell Delivers in the Clutch
---------------------------------------

Ice in his veins! ICE. IN. HIS. VEINS. D’Angelo Russell has been known as a clutch shot-maker since his days at Ohio State. And he got back to his old ways during Minnesota’s game with Oklahoma City last night.

With the score tied and less than five seconds to go, Russell connected with a three-pointer to give the Timberwolves the 106-103 lead and the win. The Thunder were without all three of the point guards on the roster, so the game being that close should also be a bit concerning for Wolves fans. But for a team trying to improve, every little bit helps. This was a good victory.

Russell finished with 21 points and six assists, while Malik Beasley added 24 points. Minnesota improved to 6-16 on the season but is still 2.5 games behind the Dallas Mavericks at the bottom of the Western Conference.
