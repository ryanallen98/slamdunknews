Even though we all saw Tom Brady and Patrick Mahomes guide their teams to the Super Bowl on Sunday, there was plenty of exciting NBA action taking place as well. There are a number of things from the day's action worth mentioning, so we take a quick look at some of them.

Hayward Delivers Charlotte a Win
--------------------------------

It should come as no surprise that Gordon Hayward is averaging over 24 points per game while hitting nearly 52% of his shots for the Hornets this year. He was doing things like this during his final year in Utah, where he was still the number one option on offense and not relegated to the third- or fourth-best player as he was with the Celtics.

  

Charlotte could have iced Orlando earlier in the game on Sunday, but Bismack Biyombo missed a pair of free throws with 25 seconds left, keeping the Hornets' lead at three. Orlando got a quick three to tie it, but with seven seconds to go, Hayward drove for a lay-up out of an iso and got it to go through. It broke the tie and helped lift Charlotte to the win column.

  

Hayward scored 39 points in all, his second game in a row with 30-plus points and the third time in his last five contests. The Hornets took a lot of flak for paying over $120 million for Hayward this past offseason, but he has been delivering thus far, and it now looks like a great signing.

Knicks Rookie Paying Dividends
------------------------------

This section will not be about No. 8 pick Obi Toppin, but instead, it deals with pick No. 26, Immanuel Quickley. The Knicks rookie guard out of Kentucky has not been consistently receiving big minutes, but he sure does know how to capitalize on his opportunity.

  

Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau has never been in favor of playing first-year guys for too many minutes.

  

On Sunday night, Quickley logged 24 minutes against the Trail Blazers, and he did more than the team could have ever asked. He helped guide them into a tight finish after trailing by as many as 25.

  

He scored 31 points on 9-of-18 shooting, including 5-of-8 from three-point range, sinking an additional 10 free throws, an area he has been thriving in.

  

The continued lack of consistency from Elfrid Payton could eventually force Thibodeau to throw Quickley into the starting lineup. And whether or not he gets that now, it's clear he's always ready.

  

He had logged fewer than 20 minutes in three straight games prior to this one.

Brown Makes a Little History
----------------------------

Sunday was a perfect day for the Boston Celtics. They found out it would be the last time they would be taking the floor without Jayson Tatum, and they managed to score 142 points against a pretty stout Cavaliers defense.

  

In addition to that, Jaylen Brown did something that had not previously happened in the shot clock era.

  

He scored 33 points in 19 minutes, marking him as the first guy to ever put up over 30 points in fewer than 20 minutes. First-half foul trouble and an ever-growing lead made this possible for him.

  

Brown shot 13-of-20 from the floor and was just unstoppable all evening when he was in. A hearty congratulations to him, and a smile, as the Celtics now have Tatum and Brown together and healthy again.
