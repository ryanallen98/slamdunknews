It was not a busy Saturday night in the NBA, with just five games on the slate. Two of them were postponed to abhorrent weather, and the roads in Texas still being as slick as ever. That kept the Spurs and Rockets among the four teams out of action as a result.

However, there was still plenty of exciting NBA action. Here are some of the highlights.

Terry Rozier At the Horn!
-------------------------

The Warriors' loss to the Hornets will be contested by the team for a long time. Stephen Curry wasn’t playing, but Golden State held a two-point lead with nine seconds left. There was a loose ball and a scrum featuring Draymond Green and Gordon Hayward fighting for possession. The officials chose to give Hayward, who didn’t have a clear recovery, a timeout. This infuriated Green.

Green was assessed two technical fouls and was promptly ejected. Charlotte made both free-throws and also retained possession. And on the ensuing play, Rozier got the ball and dribbled over to the baseline before burying a last-second winner.

Replay showed Rozier might have gotten away with a double-dribble. The last-two-minute report from this game could infuriate Golden State fans and players alike.

Heat Hold Off Lakers in Battle of Short-Handed Foes
---------------------------------------------------

In the first rematch of the 2020 NBA Finals, the Lakers and Heat battled until the final whistle. Miami was without Goran Dragic and Avery Bradley, among several missing players. The Lakers didn’t have Anthony Davis or Dennis Schroder. So the game was about other players stepping up for each side.

Miami got 27 points from Kendrick Nunn and a rare double-double from Duncan Robinson. Bam Adebayo finished with a double-double. And Jimmy Butler scored 24. But Max Strus missed seven threes, while Kelly Olynyk was silent all night in 29 minutes.

LeBron James and Kyle Kuzma shot 15-42 combined, though each played fantastic defense when needed. L.A. was down by two with seven seconds left off a Wesley Matthews put-back lay-in. They stole the ensuing inbounds pass off a Miami timeout and drove it down the floor quickly. Alex Caruso had a 22-foot jumper that could have sent the game to overtime, but it unfortunately fell short, giving Miami the victory.

LaVine Furthers All-Star Case
-----------------------------

Zach LaVine isn’t an All-Star yet, but he made a strong argument for himself before Tuesday's roster reveal. LaVine scored 38 to lift the Bulls to a 122-114 win over Sacramento last night.

In doing so, he became the first Bulls player since Michael Jordan to average 35+ points over an eight-game stretch. LaVine also showed off some defensive prowess with a game-high three steals.

Wizards Win Fourth Straight, Knock off Portland
-----------------------------------------------

After a 6-17 start to the season, the Wizards have now won four games in a row. The big difference now is that when Russell Westbrook posts a triple-double, Washington gets the win. Beal and Westbrook combined for 60, while Rui Hachimura scored 17, and Robin Lopez double-doubled off the bench.

Believe it or not, the Wizards are just 1.5 games out of being in the play-in tournament. There is a lot of basketball left to be played this year, but Washington will be without Thomas Bryant (ACL), who is done for the season.
