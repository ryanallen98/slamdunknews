The Big 12 Tournament continues on Friday with a **semifinal matchup** between the (5) Oklahoma State Cowboys (19-7, 11-7 Big 12) and the (1) Baylor Bears (22-1, 13-1 Big 12) from the T-Mobile Center in Kansas City. Tip-off is set for 6:30pm EST on ESPN. This will be the third meeting of the year between the two schools, with Baylor sweeping the season series, winning the two regular-season matchups by an average of 13 points.

OKLAHOMA STATE OUTLOOK
----------------------

The Cowboys advanced to the semis after **surviving a back-and-forth battle** with West Virginia in the quarterfinals on Thursday, ultimately winning by three to survive. Freshman sensation, Cade Cunningham, returned to the floor after missing the season finale against the Mountaineers and led Oklahoma State with 17 points and 4 assists. He also hauled in 8 rebounds, good for second on the team.

Oklahoma State has now won seven of their last eight games dating back to February 13, with their **only loss** during that stretch coming at the hands of Baylor. Cunningham missed the first meeting against the Bears due to an undisclosed reason and then rolled his ankle late in the rematch, forcing him to miss the following game against WVU on March 6.

The Cowboys enter Friday’s tilt ranked No. 12 in the country and a 3-seed in the NCAA Tournament, according to most projections. A **win over Baylor** could elevate that seeding, but a Big 12 Tournament championship would solidify it.

BAYLOR OUTLOOK
--------------

Perhaps overlooking their quarterfinal opponent, Baylor had to hold on to fend off Kansas State on Thursday, only winning by six as a 20-point favorite. The Bears pummeled the Wildcats during the regular season, winning their two meetings by an average of 40 points en route to their first Big 12 regular-season crown since 1950.

Baylor won their final three games of the regular season but proved a bit rusty coming off an extended break due to COVID and will now **face one of the hotter teams** in the country with a fully-healthy star that scored 24 against them eight days ago.

Win or lose, the Bears may still end up as a 1-seed in the field of 68, but current projections would guarantee it with a victory over the Cowboys on Friday.

BETTING LINE AND PICK
---------------------

Baylor is favored by 9 in this Big 12 Tournament semifinal with an over/under of 150. This is the first time in the three meetings that the Bears are laying single digits as they laid at least 11.5 in the first two matchups, covering just once with both games going OVER the posted totals. 150 is also the highest of any of the three totals.

The winner of this game meets the winner of the other semifinal between Texas and Kansas in the championship on Saturday. The Jayhawks might provide the most compelling matchup, as KU was the only team to defeat the Bears this season. Baylor will hold up their end of the bargain, but it won’t be easy, and 9 is too many. **Watch out for OSU** in the NCAA Tournament.

**Pick: Oklahoma State +9**
