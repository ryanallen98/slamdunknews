Russell Westbrook scored 28 points, 13 rebounds, and 21 assists in a game against the Atlanta Hawks, setting a new NBA record for triple-doubles. Westbrook now has36 triple-doubles on the season, bringing his career total to 182.

Oscar Robertson's NBA record of 181 triple-doubles had stood since 1974 and was thought to be unbreakable until Russell Westbrook surpassed it.

West brook did it on Monday night, which isn't surprising considering that he's averaging a triple-double this season, with 36 to his credit, including seven in his last eight games.

"I normally don't like to pat myself on the back, but tonight I will just because I'm so grateful for the ones before me and so blessed to the man above to allow me to go out and do it," Westbrook said. "I take this job very seriously, and I'm super grateful for my teammates and coaches on my journey so far."

As if there cord wasn't impressive enough, Westbrook also reached 8,000 career assists, joining Robertson, LeBron James, and Gary Payton as the only players in NBA history with 20,000 points or more.
