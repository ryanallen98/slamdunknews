It’s a battle in the Big 12 as the Oklahoma State Cowboys (12-5 overall, 5-5 Big 12) are in Lawrence to tangle with the Kansas Jayhawks (12-7, 6-5) in a Monday night showdown at Allen Fieldhouse. Tip-off is at 9:00 P.M. Eastern.

This is the second of two regular season meetings between the two programs, with OSU defeating Kansas, 75-70, in Stillwater on January 12. That result continued a trend in this series, with the home team going 6-1 against the spread in the last seven meetings.

Road Warriors
-------------

This game has the makings of an upset simply because of recent trends in this very scenario. The Cowboys are 5-1-1 ATS over its last seven road games, while the Jayhawks are 0-4 ATS in their previous four home games against teams with a winning record.

Oklahoma State opened their season with six straight wins and have won three out of their last four, but currently sit in seventh place in the Big 12 standings. All five of their losses have come within the conference while they are unbeaten when facing teams outside the Big 12.

Cowboys guard Cade Cunningham notched 18 points, seven rebounds, and three assists in the first matchup against Kansas. The likely one-and-done NBA prospect scored 10 points over the final 13 minutes of a Cowboys double-overtime win over the Texas Longhorns on Saturday. Cunningham is averaging 18.3 points per game and is a 41.3% shooter from beyond the arc.

Rocky Chalk
-----------

Kansas lost 91-79 to West Virginia Saturday and they have dropped five of their last seven games. Perimeter defense was an issue against the Mountaineers, who drained 11 three-pointers, which is part of a larger trend.

Over the last 10 games, Jayhawks opponents have shot 41.5% from beyond the arc. The loss was the fourth straight against a ranked opponent and fifth straight on the road.

Oklahoma State is the only team to sweep a Big 12 season series against Kansas with Bill Self as the head coach, doing so in 2017-18.

In the loss to WVU, all five Kansas starters scored in double figures, but production off the bench was virtually non-existent as the reserves combined for just four points.

Betting Line and Pick
---------------------

Kansas is a five-point home favorite in this Monday night matchup with an over/under of 140.5. Oddsmakers may have factored Cowboy fatigue into the line as Oklahoma State played 50 minutes on Saturday with four of their players notching more than 40 minutes against the Longhorns.

The Cowboys entered last week just outside of the A.P. Top 25 and will likely enter the Top 25 poll when the new rankings are announced (not available at time of publication). While they could be affected by the grueling win this past Saturday, this is a case of two teams going in opposite directions, and catching five points is a bonus for Cowboy backers.

The Cowboys are 6-3 ATS in their last nine games versus Big 12 opponents, and the Jayhawks are 2-5 ATS in their last seven conference tilts.

**Betting Pick: Oklahoma State Cowboys (+5).**
