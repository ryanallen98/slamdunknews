The First Round of the NCAA Tournament continues on Friday with a matchup in the Midwest Region between the 7-seed Clemson Tigers (16-7) and the 10-seed Scarlet Knights of Rutgers (15-11). Tip-off from Bankers Life Fieldhouse in Indianapolis is set for 9:20pm EST. This will be just the **fourth meeting all-time between the two programs**, with Clemson holding a 2-1 series edge, though Rutgers pulled off a five-point win on the road back in 2014.

CLEMSON OUTLOOK
---------------

The Tigers earned the 7th seed in the Midwest Region after finishing fifth in the ACC and losing their 2nd Round matchup to Miami in the conference tournament. Despite the early exit at the hands of the 13th seed, Clemson was **strong down the stretch**, winning six of their last seven regular-season games, three of which came against teams that also qualified for the NCAA Tournament.

This is Clemson’s 13th NCAA Tournament appearance overall and third under 11th-year head coach Brad Brownell. Their last appearance came in 2018 when they advanced to the Sweet 16. The program’s best finish ever came in 1980 when the Tigers got to the Elite Eight.

Aamir Sims will be the **player to watch for** the Tigers, facing a Rutgers defense that doesn’t really feature a power forward to match up against. Sims is a finalist for the Karl Malone Award and led the team in scoring, rebounding, and assists. He was the 6th man on that Sweet 16 team in ’18.

RUTGERS OUTLOOK
---------------

The Scarlet Knights enter as the 10-seed in the Midwest Region after a 6th place finish in the Big Ten, widely **regarded as the best conference** in the country this year. Rutgers knocked off Indiana in the 2nd Round of the conference tournament before falling to the eventual champions, Illinois, in the quarterfinals last Thursday.

This will be Rutgers’ seventh NCAA Tournament appearance but the school’s first since 1991. The Scarlet Knights are 5-7 overall in the Big Dance and 3-3 in first-round games, with their last win coming in 1983.

In their **first challenge against a ranked opponent this season**, Rutgers answered the bell and knocked off the Fighting Illini at home on December 20. It was tough sledding from there, however, as they would go on to lose their remaining six against teams in the Top 25, all from the Big Ten.

BETTING LINE AND PICK
---------------------

Rutgers gets the slight edge in the books, laying 1.5 points in this First Round matchup, with an over/under of 125.5. Both teams were fairly even against the number this season, going a combined 24-23-2 ATS.

The winner of this game will go on to face the winner between Houston and Cleveland State on Sunday, with either team likely looking at a big number against a Cougars team that has their sights set on the Final Four.

This has the makings of a tough, physical, drag-em-out contest which would play to the under, but Rutgers has the edge defensively, and without a standout star offensively on either side, we’ll **give the edge to the Scarlet Knights**.

**Pick: Rutgers -1.5**
