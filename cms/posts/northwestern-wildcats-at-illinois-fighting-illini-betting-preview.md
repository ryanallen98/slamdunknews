We have a Big Ten battle on the hardwood as the Northwestern Wildcats (6-12, 3-11 Big Ten) make the three-hour trek to Champaign to take on the Illinois Fighting Illini (14-5, 10-3 Big Ten) inside the State Farm Center on Wednesday night. Tip-off is set for 9:00 pm EST. This is the **second meeting** between the two schools this season, with Illinois coasting to a 25-point win in Evanston back on January 7 to cap off a four-game win streak at the time.

NORTHWESTERN OUTLOOK
--------------------

Meanwhile, the Wildcats are **mired in an 11-game slump** that began before the new year. Northwestern hasn’t won a game since December 26, when they upset Ohio State by a single point. The Buckeyes have only lost once since that game, climbing all the way to the number four spot in the rankings, while the Wildcats have gone on a tailspin, dropping to second from the bottom in the Big Ten standings.

Northwestern is faced with another top-5 task on Wednesday in Illinois, and winning on the road has **proven difficult** all year. Chris Collins’ bunch is just 1-7 SU away from home, one of four Big Ten teams with fewer than two road wins on their resumes this year.

Last time out, the Wildcats fell to Rutgers in Piscataway on Saturday by 14, **producing their lowest-scoring game** of the season while shooting just 33% from the field.

ILLINOIS OUTLOOK
----------------

We noted the Illini’s **four-game winning streak** that spanned from December 23-January 7, but that was followed by a season-worst two-game skid with losses to Maryland and Ohio State. But since the defeat to the Buckeyes on January 16, Illinois has reeled off five wins in a row, two of which were decided in overtime.

At the beginning of the win streak, Brad Underwood’s group was ranked 22nd on January 19. Heading into Wednesday’s game with Northwestern, they’ve climbed all the way to the No. 5 spot and have a **top seed** in the NCAA Tournament in their crosshairs. Their season finale against the Buckeyes looms as a major decider in conference tourney seeding, as well as a potential matchup to determine who sits on the top line come March Madness.

BETTING LINE AND PICK
---------------------

Illinois is **favored by 12.5** in this Big Ten battle Wednesday night, with an over/under of 144. In the first meeting, the Illini easily covered as 6.5-point road favorites, with the 137 combined points going under the posted total of 148.

If not for Luka Garza, Illinois might have two players **competing** for Big Ten Player of the Year in Ayo Dosunmu and Kofi Cockburn. Dosunmu is second in the conference in scoring and third in assists, while Cockburn is fifth in scoring and first in rebounds. The last time these teams met, Cockburn had 18 and 12, while Dosunmu went for 15, 5, and 6 in a balanced blowout.

Expect more of the same in the rematch in a game that could get ugly early. Since their last loss, **Illinois is 4-1 ATS** and 3-0 ATS at home. This team is on a renewed mission.

**Pick: Illinois -12.5**
