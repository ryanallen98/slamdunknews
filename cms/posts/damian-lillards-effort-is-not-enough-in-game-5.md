Despite yet another outstanding postseason performance, Portland's superstar is just one loss away from missing out on a trip to the NBA Finals. After seeing Damian Lillard's basketball masterpiece, which spanned four quarters, two overtime periods, and too many head-shaking enormous shots to count, everyone said about him on Tuesday, "He stole your oxygen away."

When it mattered most, Lillard was outstanding for the Blazers in Game 5 against the Nuggets, and there was nothing Denver could do. At the conclusion of regulation and the first overtime, the Nuggets could have thrown him a double team.

“Superhuman” is how Nuggets coach Michael Malone described him.

The Nuggets are currently up 3-2, which reminds us of the other, less savoury meaning of Dame Time: his never-ending playoffs shelf life.
