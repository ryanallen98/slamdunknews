A pair of top-ten defenses clash at the Staples Center on Monday night when the Miami Heat face the Los Angeles Clippers.

Miami finds itself a half-game back of the No. 8 seed in the East and winners in four of their past five games. The Clippers, winners of three in a row, might be without their two superstars. Let’s find out where the best value lies in this interconference matchup.

Miami Heat
----------

Miami is now 11-15 on the season after reaching the finals last year. The team was decimated by injuries and lost 10 of 13 games towards the end of January. With Jimmy Butler back, however, the Heat appear to be rounding into form.

A 112-94 loss on Saturday to the Jazz curbed a season-high four-game win streak, but a loss to the team with the NBA’s best record won’t derail the train.

Injuries are still an issue for Miami. Goran Dragic will miss his fifth straight game with a sprained ankle. The Heat did get Tyler Herro (Health and Safety Protocol) back against Utah after missing Thursday’s game in Houston.

With Dragic out, Kendrick Nunn has been resurgent in February. He missed three games at the beginning of the month but has been a nearly unstoppable scoring threat in 2021. After scoring 10+ points just once in the first six games of the year, Nunn has now rattled off double digits in 12 straight contests.

Los Angeles Clippers
--------------------

The Clippers are one of the best teams in the West. At 20-8, they sit 2.5 games back of Utah for the top seed.

After a 128-111 win on Sunday over the Cavaliers without Kawhi Leonard and Paul George, L.A. has won three straight. Lou Williams led the way with 30 points and ten assists in a rare starting role, while Marcus Morris Sr. and Serge Ibaka each contributed with 23 and 21 points, respectively.

The new winning streak comes on the heels of losing three out of four for the first time this year. Those wins came against Minnesota, Chicago, and Cleveland, but they will need Kawhi and PG healthy for their next stretch of games. Following this game, the Clippers have a two-game series with Utah before hosting Brooklyn.

George is in jeopardy of missing his sixth straight game with a toe injury. Leonard, who sat out on Sunday with a lower-leg bruise, is considered day-to-day.

What to Wager
-------------

The Clippers narrowly edged the Heat, 109-105, back on January 29 in Miami. Down 18, L.A. stormed back to outscore Miami 69-36 in the second and third quarters. That game was played without Leonard, George, Butler, or Dragic.

The second time around is likely to be a completely different matchup, but if LA’s two stars remain out, the Heat retain value at +6.

Each of the Clippers’ last ten wins have come against teams under .500. Though the Heat qualify at 11-15, they are a better team when Butler plays. Seeing as it looks unlikely Leonard and George play, getting six points is excellent value for Miami. All you need is a close game. I’m happy to jump on that and call it a day.

The Pick: Miami Heat (+6).
