The Maryland Terrapins will be looking for another win over a ranked conference opponent when they host the No. 14 Wisconsin Badgers Wednesday night. The Terrapins have won three of their last four games, including victories over then-No. 12 Illinois and then-No. 17 Minnesota.

  

The Badgers have won two of their last three games but fell to No. 13 Ohio State in their most recent outing.

  

The moneyline on this game is Wisconsin -175, while Maryland checks in at +143. The Badgers are favored by 3.5 points, and the over/under is 135.

Getting Back on Track
---------------------

The Badgers come into play with a record of 12-4, including a 6-3 mark in conference play. The Badgers are ranked No. 14 in the country in the latest AP poll but dropped a bit after losing to Ohio State on Saturday.

  

That loss was just the second in the last 20 home games for Wisconsin. The Badgers fell behind by 13 early in the second half and could not recover.

  

Wisconsin was led by senior forward Aleem Ford, who scored 13 points and grabbed seven rebounds. Senior guard D’Mitrik Trice scored 12 points and dished out eight assists.

  

The Badgers shot just 40% from the field, including going just 7-of-28 from three-point range. Wisconsin also shot just 60% from the free-throw line in a game that they never led.

  

On the season, the Badgers are led by Trice, who is averaging 14.6 points and 3.9 assists per game. Senior forward Micah Potter is averaging 12.1 points and leads the team, averaging 6.5 rebounds per contest.

  

The team shoots 44% on average from the field and 38% from three-point range.

Building the Tournament Resume
------------------------------

The Terrapins come into play with a record of 9-7, including 3-6 in Big Ten play. However, Maryland’s wins in the conference have come against Illinois, Minnesota, and Wisconsin.

  

So, if the Terrapins can get more consistent, they could be a sleeper team in the NCAA Tournament if they can rack up enough wins to get there.

  

In their last game, the Terrapins dominated Minnesota 63-49. Eric Ayala scored 21 points and had three steals in Maryland’s third road win in the conference — all against ranked opponents.

  

Donta Scott had a huge game, scoring 15 points and grabbing 11 rebounds, and Aaron Wiggins also had a double-digit rebounding total in the win.

  

On the season, the Terrapins are led by Ayala, who is averaging 14.4 points per game. Scott leads the team in rebounding to go along with his 13 points-per-game average. He is pulling down nearly seven rebounds per game.

Betting Prediction
------------------

Maryland has been a dragon slayer on the road this season, but they are just 1-3 in the conference at home. In order for them to become a real consideration for the NCAA Tournament, they will have to win games like this at home.

  

The Badgers are a very good team, and they have senior leadership that helps in games like this. Take the Badgers -3.5 in this one.
