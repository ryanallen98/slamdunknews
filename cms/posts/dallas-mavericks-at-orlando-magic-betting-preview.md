The Dallas Mavericks have a chance to surpass the .500 plateau for the **first time** in over a month on Monday night when they travel to Orlando to take on the Magic.

Winners of seven of their last nine games, the Mavericks are coming off a win in Brooklyn, who was without Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving. Orlando has **lost three straight** after a three-game winning streak and has sunk to eight games below .500.

This is the **second meeting** between these two teams this year. The Mavericks held the Magic under 100 points with a 112-98 victory on January 10. Even without Kristaps Porzingis, Luka Doncic was the team’s third-leading scorer behind Tim Hardaway Jr. (36) and Trey Burke (29).

Let’s take a look at matchup number two to find the **best play** possible.

Dallas Mavericks
----------------

What a strange season it has been for Dallas. There was a real concern when the team sat at 8-13, but the **recent stretch of good form** has them right back in the playoff picture. The Mavericks currently sit in the #9 position, which would put them in the play-in round. With just two games remaining before the All-Star Break, they are only 2.5 games back of the #5 seed.

The concern when Dallas struggled was **their depth** behind Porzingis and Doncic. The role players have stepped up to provide the necessary spark during their winning run.

Josh Richardson has **scored in double figures** in eight of the past nine games. Hardaway Jr. has scored 10+ in 12 of the last 13, and Jalen Brunson has done so in seven straight.

Orlando Magic
-------------

The dreadful string of games that placed Orlando eight games under .500 seemed to be behind the team. They had **lost 15 out of 18 games** from January 9 through February 12. The Magic then rattled off four wins in five games, and skies didn’t look as grey.

Three of the wins for Orlando came against Sacramento, New York, and Detroit. The team lost the back-end game of a two-game series with the Pistons. That loss set their **three-game losing streak** in motion following losses to Brooklyn (by 37) and Utah (by 15).

Things **don’t get any easier** for the Magic after Monday night. They face Atlanta on Wednesday, their final game before the All-Star Break. The next 11 games after the break are against teams currently in a top-8 playoff spot.

What to wager
-------------

Dallas has proven that they have turned the corner and can now be trusted to win games like this one. The oddsmakers believe the same, as the **Mavericks are seven-point favorites** on Monday night. The over/under stands at 224.5.

I do believe the Mavs will win the game, **but laying seven points** and -265 on the moneyline are big enough adjustments for me to back away from those wagers.

A lot of Dallas’ success has come from their **recent commitment to defense**. They have held two opponents under 100 points over their last three wins. They previously hadn’t held anyone under 100 since January 14. On the other side, Orlando has either kept their opponent under 100 or been held under the mark themselves in five of the last seven games.

I’ll **take my chances with the under** based on these teams’ trajectories.

**The Pick: Under 224.5 (-110)**
