With 146 days under their belts, the NBA regular season in 2020-21 will be down to the final three days. Only two of the 20 playoff seeds in both conferences have been determined, with 98 percent of the season completed: the San Antonio Spurs at No. 10 in the Western Conference and the Boston Celtics at No. 8 in the Eastern Conference.

The remaining 18 races will be confirmed in the following days, with one of the most critical confrontations on Thursday night.

The universe appears to be desperate for the Lakers and Clippers to meet in the NBA's most anticipated first-round series. The Lakers were ranked No. 7, and the Clippers were ranked No. 3 in the bracket entering Thursday. So hereâ€™s the issue: The matchup between Phoenix and Portland was a catch-22.

Stotts' situation becomes more complicated when he decides to appeal the foul call. That wasn't a wrong decision in a vacuum. This isn't precisely a flagrant violation. Because losing the challenge cost Portland its final timeout, Portland could not to advance the ball or draw up a play for Damian Lillard when Phoenix regained the lead.

Although hindsight is 20/20, if the Blazers lose in the play-in round, it will be a choice that will be scrutinised for a coach who is already under fire.
