**Andre has been injured on debut as LA Lakers lose to Milwaukee Bucks.**

  

Andre Drummond was supposed to support the Lakers rediscover their mojo after a patchy past ten games.

  

The Milwaukee Bucks finally ended their losing streak with a 112-97 victory over the Los Angeles Lakers, who lost debutant Andre Drummond to injury.

  

The NBA star revealed his ghastly injury, stating:

  

"I didn't really think anything of it," Drummond said. "I came back in the second quarter and it was hurting a little bit more. And then after halftime, I finally took my sock off to look and my whole toenail was gone. So, it was just all bad from there. I couldn't walk or run. So I just told Coach Frank Vogel to take me out."

  

Andre Drummond, playing his first game in nearly seven weeks, scored four points in 14 minutes before limping off the court. 

  

Andre was supposed to help the Lakers rediscover their charm after a curse of patchy games. The newcomer Drummond only scored four points, one rebound, and two assists in 14 minutes before injuring his right toe.   

  

The Lakers announced that X-rays on a significant right toe contusion were negative.

  

Coach Frank Vogel said after the game, Drummond would be re-evaluated on later this week and would update everyone on his status day-to-day. 

  

The Lakers are due to play on Friday on the road against the Sacramento Kings.
