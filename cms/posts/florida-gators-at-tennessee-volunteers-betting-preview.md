The SEC regular-season slate comes to a close on Sunday as the Florida Gators (13-7, 9-6 SEC) are in Knoxville to take on the Tennessee Volunteers (16-7, 9-7 SEC) inside Thompson-Boling Arena. Tip-off is set for 12:00pm EST on ESPNU. The Gators **chomped up** the Volunteers in the first meeting back on January 19, with Florida winning, going away over then 6th-ranked Tennessee, 75-49.

There is **plenty on the line** in the rematch as the rest of the conference watches to see how the SEC Tournament bracket is finalized. The winner secures the 4-seed and the all-important double-bye into the quarterfinals, which wouldn’t tip until Friday in Nashville. Let’s take a look at the implications.

FLORIDA OUTLOOK
---------------

The Gators had their **three-game winning streak snapped** on Wednesday when Missouri hung on for a two-point win for their first-ever victory in Gainesville. As noted, winning on Sunday earns Florida the 4-seed in next week’s tourney, while a loss would drop them to the 5-spot. As the 5-seed, they would play on Thursday afternoon against the winner of the (12) Texas A&M vs. (13) Vanderbilt game on Wednesday evening.

Tre Mann is Florida’s **leading scorer and rebounder**, averaging 15.0 ppg and 5.7 rpg in his sophomore season. He has become a player to watch in the postseason, as he has scored 20.3 ppg over his last three games.

TENNESSEE OUTLOOK
-----------------

Like Florida, Tennessee can secure the 4-seed with a win on Sunday, but if they lose, the Vols will drop to the 6th spot in the conference tournament, with Ole Miss grabbing the 5-seed. A win could even provide a **quarterfinal rematch** between these two if a hypothetical 5-seeded Florida defeated A&M or Vandy.

As the No. 6 seed, the Volunteers would play No. 11-seed South Carolina in the late game Thursday night, with the winner advancing to face No. 3 LSU in the late game Friday night. Missouri winning Saturday and Tennessee losing Sunday would’ve meant the Vols falling to the No. 7 seed. The Tigers’ win over Florida on Wednesday **kept hope alive** that Tennessee could finish as high as fourth in the final standings.

Tennessee certainly must have **revenge on their minds** as the blowout loss to Florida flipped the script on the entire season. After starting the year with 10 wins in their first 11 games, they’re just 6-6 over their last 12, which began with that embarrassment in Gainesville.

BETTING LINE AND PICK
---------------------

Tennessee is **favored in this SEC finale by 5.5**, with an over/under of 136.5. The Vols were 8.5-point favorites in the first meeting, with the 124 combined points going UNDER the posted total of 136.

This seems easy as Florida has been playing better as of late. They rolled in the first meeting, their 4-1 ATS in their last 5 road games, and Tennessee is 3-7 ATS in their last 10 games as a home favorite. Yet, the **Vols are the chalk here and rather significantly** at that. This comes down to going against the grain, and we’re siding with the home team.

**Pick: Tennessee -5.5**
