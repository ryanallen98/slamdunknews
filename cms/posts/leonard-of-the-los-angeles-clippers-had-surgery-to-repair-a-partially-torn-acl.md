The Los Angeles Clippers announced on Tuesday that star player Kawhi Leonard had surgery to repair a partly torn ACL in his right knee. The team stated that Leonard's return has no timetable.

‍

In Game 4 of the Western Conference semi-finals against the Utah Jazz, Leonard, 30, was hurt. Los Angeles described the injury as a knee sprain, although the ACL was suspected to be involved.

‍

The Clippers, who were the No. 4 seed in the West, missed the Finals for the second year in a row after adding Leonard and Paul George. Before his injury, Leonard, a two-time Finals MVP who has won championships with the San Antonio Spurs and the Toronto Raptors, averaged 30.4 points and 7.7 rebounds per game in 11 postseason games.

‍

Leonard has a player option for the 2021-22 season.
