The NCAA Tournament’s First Four wraps up Thursday evening with, by far, the most **high-profile** matchup on the day’s card. The UCLA Bruins (17-9) from the Pac-12 take on the Big Ten’s Michigan State Spartans (15-12) inside Mackey Arena in West Lafayette, IN, with tip-off set for 9:57pm EST on TBS. The winner earns the right to advance to the First Round to take on BYU in the 6-11 matchup on Saturday night at Hinkle Fieldhouse.

These two blue blood basketball programs have 82 NCAA Tournament appearances between them, with **28 combined Final Fours and 13 National Championships**. This will mark just the second time they have ever met in the Big Dance, with UCLA winning the first meeting in the first round of the 2011 Tournament by two.

UCLA OUTLOOK
------------

The Bruins are **limping into March Madness**, having lost four straight games, including a Pac-12 Tournament quarterfinal loss to Oregon State last Thursday. The Beavers would go on a run, ultimately winning the whole thing to steal a bid from another potential bubble team, while UCLA did enough in the regular season to warrant an at-large spot.

UCLA did experience some real nice stretches of solid play during the regular season, however, stringing together win streaks of four, five, and seven games during different spots of the year. They fall into some hard luck over the final two weeks, though, losing all four games by single digits.

MICHIGAN STATE OUTLOOK
----------------------

Like their First Four opponent, the Spartans were one of the last four teams invited to the tournament, securing their 23rd consecutive appearance in the Field of 68. They, too, however, were one-and-done in their conference tourney, getting knocked out by Maryland in the second round of the Big Ten Tournament last Thursday.

Michigan State hung their tournament resume hats on the fact that they **earned five wins over ranked opponents** during their 2020-21 campaign, capped off by a win over Michigan in their regular-season finale.

BETTING LINE AND PICK
---------------------

Michigan State is **favored by 2** in this First Four matchup, with an over/under of 135.5. Neither team was particularly strong against the number this season, going a combined 21-32 ATS. Many of the recent trends would seem to favor UCLA as the Bruins are 7-3 ATS in their last 10 games as an underdog while the Spartans are 2-10 ATS in their last 12 games as a favorite and 2-5 ATS in their last 7 NCAA Tournament games as a favorite.

However, MSU has the **edge on the sidelines**, with Tom Izzo running the show. Izzo is a national champion and a Hall-of-Famer, while his counterpart, Mick Cronin, is just 6-11 all-time in the NCAA Tournament. Those 17 games came as head coach of Murray State and Cincinnati, while this will be his first dip as the man in charge of UCLA.

This will be a fun way to cap off a four-game slate heading into Friday’s card, and the Spartans will survive and advance.

**Pick: Michigan State -2**
