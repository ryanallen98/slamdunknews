Pau Gasol announced his retirement from basketball on Tuesday, and the Lakers are set to retire his jersey soon. 

 

Pau Gasol, the former Los Angeles Lakers big man, is anticipated to join the ranks of franchise immortals shortly, as the team is reportedly planning to retire his jersey. The news comes after Gasol announced his retirement from basketball earlier on Tuesday, according to Kyle Goon of the Southern California News Group and Shams Charania of The Athletic. Pau Gasol announced his retirement from basketball on Tuesday, and the Lakers are set to retire his jersey soon. 

 

NBA Commissioner Adam Silver issued the following statement:

 

“Pau Gasol is undoubtedly one of the most accomplished players of his generation. A two-time NBA champion, six-time NBA All-Star, three-time Olympic medalist and world champion, Paul inspired countless fans through his remarkable skill and passion for the game. But what sets Pau apart is his tireless commitment to giving back to his native Spain and other communities around the world, which he continues to make a priority. We congratulate Pau on an outstanding career and thank him for being such a dedicated ambassador for our league.”

 

On Tuesday, he announced his retirement from basketball, capping a career that spanned more than two decades and included two NBA championships and a world championship gold with Spain's national team.

 

In having his No. 16 retired by the Lakers, Gasol would become the 11th player to receive that honour and the first since Kobe Bryant had his Nos. 8 and 24 retired in 2017. The other numbers retired by the Lakers: Wilt Chamberlain (No. 13), Elgin Baylor (No. 22), Gail Goodrich (No. 25), Magic Johnson (No. 32), Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (No. 33), Shaquille O’Neal (No. 34), James Worthy (No. 42), Jerry West (No. 44) and Jamaal Wilkes (No. 52).

 

The Lakers acquired Gasol and a second-round selection from the Memphis Grizzlies during the 2008 trade deadline in exchange for Kwame Brown, Javarr Crittenton, Marc Gasol, Aaron McKie, and two future first-round picks. 

 

Gasol, 41, announced his retirement from international basketball in August, after Spain was defeated by the United States in the quarterfinals of the Tokyo Olympics, his fifth.

 

Gasol had been with Barcelona, a Spanish team since February. His career had previously stagnated due to a left-foot stress fracture that had persisted for over two years, preventing him from playing.

 

“I’m going to retire from professional basketball,” Gasol said. “It’s a difficult decision after so many years, but it’s a decision that I really thought over.”

 

Gasol won two NBA championships with the Los Angeles Lakers in 2009 and 2010, while also playing with the Memphis Grizzlies, Chicago Bulls, San Antonio Spurs, and Milwaukee Bucks, averaging 17 points and 9.2 rebounds in 1,226 regular-season games. He was the third overall choice in the 2001 NBA Draft, chosen by Atlanta and later traded to Memphis.

 

Gasol last appeared in the NBA in 2019 with the Milwaukee Bucks. That year, he signed with the Portland Trail Blazers but never played. 

 

In 2006, Gasol won a world championship with Spain, as well as European titles in 2009, 2011 and 2015.
