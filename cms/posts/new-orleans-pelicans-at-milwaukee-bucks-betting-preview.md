The New Orleans Pelicans and newly anointed All-Star Zion Williamson travel north to visit the Milwaukee Bucks and All-Star starter Giannis Antetokounmpo on Thursday night.

This is the second meeting between these two sides. The Pelicans pulled out a 131-126 victory in New Orleans at the end of January. Antetokounmpo’s 38 points were not enough, as four different Pelicans scored 20+ points.

The Bucks are in the thick of the race for the top seed in the Eastern Conference, while the Pelicans are currently outside the playoff race in the West. Let’s find value in this meeting of two of the NBA’s biggest stars.

New Orleans Pelicans Trends
---------------------------

In year two of Zion, many New Orleans fans knew there would be positive progression. Fans also knew they would have to take the bad with the good. At 14-17, the team has had stretches of both.

They have been streaky this year. A run of eight losses in nine games placed them at 5-10 in January. Immediately following that run, they reeled off six wins in eight. A gritty Sunday afternoon overtime win against Boston preceded a seemingly routine win over Detroit on Wednesday night.

The Pelicans have not been good on the back end of back-to-backs this year, losing four of their five games after playing the night before.

Milwaukee Bucks Trends
----------------------

Milwaukee appears to be back on track after an uncharacteristic five-game losing streak. The team has since rattled off three straight wins to climb back to 19-13, just two games back of Philadelphia for the top seed in the East. The five-game skid was the longest for the franchise since the team lost ten of eleven in January / February of 2017.

Antetokounmpo, the two-time reigning MVP of the league, has continued to perform at an elite level. The Greek Freak has led the team in both points and rebounds in 18 of the team’s last 19 games. Over the last month, Antetokounmpo and Joel Embiid are the only players averaging at least 30 points per game and a double-double.

Former Pelican Jrue Holiday has been in COVID-19 protocol for a few weeks now and is nearing a return, but he is doubtful for Thursday night.

What to Wager
-------------

We are in for a treat with the likes of Zion and Giannis. The pair are two of just six players to average 11+ field goals per game over the last two weeks. At 68%, no one had been more efficient than Williamson.

In New Orleans’ win over the Bucks last month, both Eric Bledsoe and Lonzo Ball netted seven threes. For Ball, that tied a career-best mark. The team hit 21 threes in total at 43.8% from beyond the arc. I expect the Bucks to make the appropriate adjustments to shut down the three-ball.

The Bucks are nine-point favorites with the over / under set at 242.5. Both of those numbers are right on the margins. These two teams score a lot of points, but Milwaukee can shut down any offense of any given night.

For those reasons, I will turn to the player props. Giannis will get his points, but 32.5 is too much to take the over. The same goes for Williamson’s 26.5. I’m looking for a Milwaukee role player to step up in Holiday’s absence.

Donte DiVincenzo’s point total sits at 11.5. The sharpshooter has scored 12+ points in five of the last six games. If Holiday sits again, DiVincenzo is my pick.

‍

**The Pick: DiVincenzo over 11.5 points (-115)**
