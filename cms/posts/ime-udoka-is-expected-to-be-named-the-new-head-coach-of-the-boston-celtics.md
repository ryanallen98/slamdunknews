According to sources, the Boston Celtics and Brooklyn Nets assistant Ime Udoka are finalising a deal for Udoka to become the team's new head coach.

‍

Udoka, 43, is a long-time disciple of San Antonio Spurs coach Gregg Popovich, having worked on Popovich's Spurs staff as an assistant coach for seven years and serving as his assistant at the 2019 World Cup tournament.

‍

Before retiring in 2012 and joining Popovich's staff in San Antonio, the Portland, Oregon native appeared in 316 games for the Los Angeles Lakers, New York Knicks, Portland Trail Blazers, Sacramento Kings, and Spurs, averaging 5.2 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.

‍

Udoka inherits a Celtics squad that had reached the Eastern Conference finals three of the previous four seasons before slipping to the No. 7 seed and falling in the first round to Brooklyn this year. Following the team's five-game loss to the Nets, basketball president Danny Ainge announced his retirement, and coach Brad Stevens gave up his spot on the bench to take his place.

‍

The Celtics, who were once expected to fight for a playoff berth, appear to be losing ground in the East. Even though Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown have established themselves as stars, the team has failed to find additional pieces capable of competing with the assembled stars in Milwaukee, Philadelphia, and now Brooklyn and Atlanta.

‍

Former Celtics coach Brad Stevens' first significant move after taking over the front office was to trade injured point player Kemba Walker to Oklahoma City for big man Al Horford, in exchange for the team's first-round lottery pick.
