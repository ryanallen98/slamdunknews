Two **Eastern Conference** teams meet on Sunday night when the **Toronto Raptors** make a visit to the United Center to battle the **Chicago Bulls**. This is the first meeting between the two sides this year after their matchup on March 1 was postponed.

The **Raptors are struggling**, having lost four in a row and six of their last seven. They come in on the heels of a Saturday night loss in Charlotte and sit a game back of the #8 seed at 17-21.

**The Bulls, at 16-20, are right next to Toronto in the standings**. They are also searching for their first win after the All-Star Break, losers of two straight, four of their last five, and four in a row at home.

Let’s look at both teams to see who is due to bounce back.

Toronto Raptors
---------------

Those in the **North** are far removed from their championship run of two years ago. The sailing in 2021 just has not been as smooth as Raptors fans had hoped.

**Toronto** are the team of mini-streaks this year, and that is how you tend to become a .500 team. They have won two games in a row twice, three in a row twice and four straight once, accounting for 14 of their 17 wins on the year. On the flip side, they have three two-game losing streaks, three skids of three games, and one of four. That makes up for 19 of their 21 losses.

The team remains riddled with injuries, mostly due to Covid protocols. **Fred VanVleet**, **Pascal Siakam**, and **OG Anunoby** are the three major contributors who are all likely to miss their fifth straight game due to the protocols.

Chicago Bulls
-------------

After a pair of double-digit losses to Philadelphia and Miami, the **Bulls** will attempt to find their form again with two games against sub-.500 teams. They will see Oklahoma City on Tuesday following their Sunday night matchup with the Raptors.

The best news in **Chicago** following the All-Star Break has been the return of Lauri Markkanen. The Finnish forward missed 13 games with a shoulder injury but returned on Thursday and clocked in with 23 points on seven made threes in seven attempts. He followed that up with a 20-point performance on Friday on a more modest 8-of-18 shooting (4/10 3FG).

While **Markkanen**, **Zach LaVine** (28.5 ppg), **Coby White** (18+ points in seven of eight games), and **Thaddeus Young** (14.3 pts, 7.3 rebs, 3.0 asts, 1.8 steals, and 1.5 blocks per game over the last two weeks) have all played their role, there is concern around Wendell Carter Jr’s output. The third-year pro has been atrocious on offense. Over the last five contests, he is 9-for-31 (29%) with 29 total points.

What to wager
-------------

**Chicago have lost four games in a row at home**, and **Toronto have lost three in a row away from home**. Something will have to give on Sunday night.

The **Bulls are listed as 3.5-point favorites**, while the total is set at 231. Chicago to right to be made the favorite since they have won seven straight games against teams under .500. They also happen to be 0-6 against teams OVER .500 in that span.

It has been **hard to trust Chicago** to finish games convincingly, and the Raptors have been able to keep their games competitive. **I still like the Bulls, but for that reason, I would rather take -150 on the moneyline than lay the 3.5 points at -110**.

I’ll take Chicago so long as Siakam, VanVleet, and Anunoby remain out.

**The Pick**: Bulls ML (-150)
