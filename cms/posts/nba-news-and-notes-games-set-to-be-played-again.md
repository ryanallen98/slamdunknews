With the **All-Star break** nearing its end, games will be played again, starting with a few on the slate for Wednesday night. The league fully ramps up again on Friday, when the schedule features a double-digit number of games. It gives teams like the Cavs, who were nursing a few injuries, the chance to get a bit healthier.

Some teams are still waiting on free agent news and buyout updates, which will be mentioned in the body of this article. Let’s roll.

Lakers and Nets the Favorites for Drummond?
-------------------------------------------

There have been plenty of rumors surrounding **Andre Drummond**, who has now been out of the Cavs lineup for over a month, as the team rolls on with Jarrett Allen, continuing to seek a trade partner for Dre. Thus far, there has been no success, as they plan for a trade rather than a buyout so that they can bring some pieces in.

If Andre does, in fact, get bought out because no trade was able to happen, rumors have been swirling that the Nets and Lakers would be the favorites. LA’s only viable BIG man is **Marc Gasol**, while Anthony Davis is continuing to rehab his injury. He doesn’t operate like a natural five, so there would be questions about his fitness, though.

And **Brooklyn** is in the mix for practically every player. They just added Blake Griffin to spruce up their bench unit. Blake was having a rough year, but he’s now in a much better situation all-around. Let’s see if the Nets would actually want Drummond, who spent parts of three years with Griffin in Detroit.

Rockets Call up Kevin Porter Jr.
--------------------------------

Cavs fans that were watching the **Vipers** in the **G-League Bubble** are probably punching the air. Their franchise could not salvage the relationship with Kevin Porter Jr., so they sent him to Houston, the only team that would take him on. He showed out over the last month or so, and now he seems primed to return to the form he showed last year.

Over 50 games a season ago, **KPJ** had some incredible performances. He’s got a tight handle with the ball and can fill up the stat sheet when he’s at his best. He’s joining a Rockets team that has lost a whopping 13 games in a row and is in need of a burst of energy. As Christian Wood remains out, Porter could be that guy for them.

It’s good to see that he appears to be in a better place, mentally, after tweeting suicidal thoughts in the fall.

Bulls Say Thad Young is Off- Limits
-----------------------------------

The Bulls front office has made some intriguing decisions in the last several years. Though, the trade of **Jimmy Butler** to bring in **Zach LaVine** looks to finally be paying off with wins. And new management has made a very wise declaration.

**Thaddeus Young**, having a career-year in several categories, was ruled untouchable in trades. Even in Lauri Markkanen’s absence, he has served as a full-time sixth man. He’s had high-assist games for the first time in his career. Truth be told, he might be the best passer on this team. He’s making every other player around him better.

Good to see that he won’t be moved, as he looks to help guide **the Bulls** to their first playoff appearance in four years.
