Kevin Durant is staying with the Brooklyn Nets for the long term.

‍

Brooklyn Nets Governor Joe Tsai said, “We know who he is. Kevin Durant will establish his legacy in Brooklyn as one of the greatest ever. On behalf of the Nets organization, my family, and our fans, we are excited and humbled to see a lot of Kevin for years to come.”

‍

On July 7, 2019, Brooklyn acquired Durant in a sign-and-trade deal with Golden State. Durant was chosen an NBA All-Star for the 11th time in his career (each of the last 11 seasons he's played in) and an All-Star Game starter for the ninth time. Durant completed his first season with the Nets after missing the previous season due to surgery to repair a ruptured Achilles tendon. He averaged 26.9 points, 7.1 rebounds, and 5.6 assists, demonstrating that he had shaken off the injury and reclaimed the form that had crowned him the 2014 NBA MVP and a four-time leading scorer.

‍

Durant won his third gold medal of his career after leading the United States to victory. In this summer's Olympic Games in Tokyo, the men's national team will compete. He previously won gold at London in 2012 and Rio de Janeiro in 2016. He's one of only four players to have been named to three or more Olympic teams, and he's the all-time greatest scorer in American hockey history. Men's basketball has a long and illustrious history in the Olympics.

‍

The contract will run through the 2022-23 season. It happened just hours before Durant led the United States to their fourth consecutive Olympic gold medal. During the competition, he became the American men's career scoring leader.
