Washington saw off Indiana to book their place in the Playoffs.

On Tuesday, the Wizards were defeated 118-100 by the Boston Celtics in their first Eastern Conference play-in game. However, Washington's last chance to make the playoffs came on Thursday, when Bradley Beal scored 25 points.

The Wizards have clinched the eighth seed in the conference and will play the top-seeded Philadelphia 76ers in the first round of the playoffs on Sunday.

The three finalists for the Most Valuable Player award for the 2020-21 regular season were also revealed on Thursday by the NBA.

Stephen Curry, the two-time MVP of the Warriors, will face Joel Embiid of the 76ers and Nikola Jokic of the Denver Nuggets.

The three finalists for each of the NBA's annual awards are chosen by a global jury of sportswriters and broadcasters, with the winners being announced during the playoffs.
