Four players including Giannis Antetokounmpo and Michael Jordan have scored 20 points in the Final quarter.

‍

In the 2021 NBA Finals, Giannis Antetokounmpo is playing with a hyperextended knee. He was initially rated as doubtful for Game 1 of this series, raising serious doubts about his ability to play in the early stages of the series.

‍

He dominated Game 1 and was even better in Game 2, scoring 42 points on 15-of-22 shooting in one of his greatest postseason performances. It wasn't enough as the Suns defeated his Bucks 118-108, but Antetokounmpo may take solace in the fact that he made history in the second half.

‍

In the third quarter, he scored 20 points, a playoff career high for the two-time MVP, and he joined some impressive company.

‍

On his way to one of his best postseason performances ever, he became the fourth player in NBA history to score 20 points in a single quarter in a finals game, joining Michael Jordan, Isiah Thomas, and Joe Dumars in the record books.

‍

Antetokounmpo put on a historic performance for the Bucks, but his teammates couldn't provide him with enough offensive support. Milwaukee's four other starters combined to score just one point more than Giannis, who scored 43 points on 19-of-52 shooting. The Bucks shot 29% from three-point range. The Suns had a 50 percent shooting percentage behind a well-balanced offensive approach.
