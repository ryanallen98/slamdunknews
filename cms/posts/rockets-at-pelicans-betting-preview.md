Two teams in the jumbled Western Conference take the court in New Orleans on Tuesday night when the New Orleans Pelicans host the Houston Rockets. Entering play on Tuesday, there are **nine teams** mixed between the 6th and 14th (second to last) spots, all separated by just 2.5 games.

The Pelicans have won three in a row, while the Rockets have **lost three of four** following their season-high six-game win streak. Let’s take a look at this matchup and find the right play.

Houston Rockets
---------------

Two games after Victor Oladipo was integrated into the lineup. The Rockets reeled off six straight. Even more **impressive**, two-thirds of those wins came on the road, and the same tally were double-digit wins.

The mini-slide over the last week includes two double-digit losses. This comes at a time when the Rockets have played a **lopsided number** of games on the road. Dating back to January 31st through February 18th, Houston plays nine of eleven away from home.

Part of the slide **can be pinned** on Christian Wood missing time. The breakout center sprained his ankle against Memphis on Thursday and will be “re-evaluated weekly”. The Rockets will also be without Oladipo, who is resting on the back end of a back-to-back.

New Orleans Pelicans
--------------------

The Pelicans’ three-game win streak is their first in almost exactly a year. They have **won five of their last seven** games, which is the bounce-back effort Stan Van Gundy’s side needed after losing eight of nine in January.

The squad enters Tuesday night with an **almost entirely** clean bill of health. Josh Hart is the only question mark with back spasms.

Zion Williamson and Brandon Ingram run the show. The duo has **averaged 52 points per game** over the last week. Williamson’s field goal percentage is sizzling at 70% this week. His 59.6% for the season is seventh in the league.

What to wager
-------------

It is more difficult to pin down the Rockets at the moment with their injury troubles. The Rockets have a +0.9 point differential this season, but it is a completely different show without Wood and Oladipo in the lineup. The Pelicans are **listed as six-point favorites**. Despite the win streak, there is too much uncertainty in New Orleans’ consistency to lay that big of a number.

When these teams met just over a week ago, **Wood led all scorers** with 27 in a 14-point Rockets’ win. Oladipo followed with 20, while Ingram struggled for New Orleans.

Williamson (11/19 FGs, 26 points) ate up an already undersized Houston frontcourt, and now Wood, their only shot-blocking threat, is out of the lineup. I expect Zion to **dominate** once again.

It generally doesn’t matter who defends the paint against the Pels. Zion is going to attack downhill regardless. His point total for Tuesday night is 23.5 at -110. There is **more than enough value** there to put your money down on a high-volume, high-efficiency scorer. He has reached at least 24 points in ten of his last 15 games. If you took over 23.5 each time, you would be at +4.5 units.

**The Pick: Zion Williamson over 23.5 points (-110)**
