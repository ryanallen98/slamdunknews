‍

Tom Thibodeau returns to the United Center to face the team he coached for five years when the New York Knicks visit the Chicago Bulls on Monday night. Thibodeau, who compiled a 245-139 record from 2010 to 2015 in Chicago, led the Bulls to their only conference finals appearance since the Michael Jordan era.

  

This year, the Knicks and Bulls are currently on the outside of the playoff picture looking in, but there are spots open for both teams who have shown signs of improvement with their new head coaches. Let’s take a look at their first matchup of the season and find value.

New York Knicks
---------------

It might surprise some, but the Knicks have the best defense in the NBA. That’s right, the Knicks, and it’s entirely a product of the new head coach. 

  

Thibodeau has always implemented a defense-first approach, and no team has allowed fewer points per game this season than the Knicks’ 103.9.

  

Unfortunately for New York, the quality of the defense has come at the expense of the offense. At 102.2 points per game, they have the lowest scoring output among all 30 NBA teams. 

  

Julius Randle has been the model of consistency this season, averaging a double-double, and RJ Barrett has shown dramatic signs of improvement.

  

The statistical surprise comes in the form of Immanuel Quickley. Thibodeau has a history of benching rookies, but Quickley, who has scored 25-plus points in three of the last four games, is one of the Knicks’ only options right now on a team desperate for scoring.

Chicago Bulls
-------------

The Bulls are coming off their most heartbreaking loss of the season. That moniker carries value too, as Chicago have lost games this year by one (twice), two (twice), three and four. 

  

With eight seconds to go and the Bulls up five, Damian Lillard buried a pair of threes (the latter of which beat the buzzer) to hand Chicago a 123-122 loss.

  

Billy Donovan’s team has been streaky, to say the least. The Bulls are in the middle of their third losing streak of three or more games. 

  

All seven of the team’s wins have come from a three-game win streak and a separate stretch of four wins in five. They also sport the third-worst defense in the NBA (118.5 points per game allowed) while remaining a top five team in scoring (115.7 points per game).

  

Chicago has been relatively healthy compared to recent seasons, but it is without Wendell Carter Jr. (severe quad contusion) for about a month. The Bulls do, however, have depth on the bench. 

  

Garrett Temple and Thaddeus Young (11 points per game each over the last two weeks) have helped carry the load as aides to Zach LaVine and Lauri Markkanen.

What To Wager
-------------

Monday’s matchup pits two very different teams against each other. Historically, high-octane teams like the Bulls that both score and allow a lot of points tend to play down to the defensive style of a team like the Knicks.

  

In today’s NBA, you can expect more than 220 points in almost every contest. This game, however, is more likely to go under 200 than over the actual number of 218.5. 

  

For that reason, I’m going to split my wager into two bets and bank on a low-scoring affair.

  

The Pick: Bulls -4 and Under 209.5
