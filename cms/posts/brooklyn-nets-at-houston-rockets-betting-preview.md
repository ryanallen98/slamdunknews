It’s a shame there will only be a limited number of fans in attendance on Wednesday night when James Harden makes his return to Houston. He and the Brooklyn Nets visit the scuffling Rockets in the **first game between the two teams since Harden was traded** from Houston on January 14.

Rest assured, you won’t need to pump up the crowd mics too much to hear what the Houston faithful have to say. If they boo their former hero, you will hear it.

The **only question** remains, will the boos be for Harden or for a Rockets team that has lost 12 straight games? To find the best bets for the night, let’s look into the matchup.

Brooklyn Nets
-------------

Even without the full trio of Harden, Kyrie Irving, and Kevin Durant, the Nets are **playing like a top-tier team**. They are 16-7 since acquiring Harden (while Houston is 8-16). Though Dallas snapped their Brooklyn-era-best eight-game winning streak, the team grinded through to win a tough overtime game in San Antonio on Monday.

Durant has played just one game since February 6, but while the team continues to roll and focus on the playoffs, Durant’s priorities are shifted towards **being healthy** for that run. Look for Durant to return at some point after the All-Star Break.

In Durant’s absence, Bruce Brown is thriving as a fill-in option. The third-year pro out of Miami has **produced double-digit scoring** (and 20+ points twice) in each of the last five games. It is the first time Brown has accomplished that feat in his career.

Houston Rockets
---------------

There is no way to coat this donut with sugar. **Zero wins** since February 6. The Rockets have not lost 12 straight games since 2001, the year before they received the first overall pick and selected Yao Ming.

Nine of their losses during this streak have been by **double digits**, including each of the last five. A team that was once a game over .500 has plummeted to 11-22 and second-to-last in the Western Conference.

Houston’s **health has been the main contributor** to the turmoil. Eric Gordon missed Monday’s game vs. Cleveland with a knee issue and is questionable. Victor Oladipo missed Sunday’s tilt against Memphis but is ready to go. Christian Wood hasn’t played since February 5, and the team parted ways with DeMarcus Cousins. David Nwaba (wrist) is also out, and Danuel House (thigh) is questionable to play. Strangely enough, John Wall has been the only consistently healthy contributor over the last month.

What to wager
-------------

The Nets are 9.5-point favorites against a team that has been beaten down badly over the last month. We have already covered the brutal double-digit losses of late for Houston. I am comfortable **laying the 9.5 points** here.

In addition, although Harden will be the main motivator in Brooklyn’s performance, Brown’s point total sits at 12.5. He has hit that number in four of the last five games (and 12 in the other game) since seeing a minutes boost without Durant. I will **ride the hot hand and take over 12.5 for his point total**.

**The Pick: Nets -9.5 (-110) & Bruce Brown over 12.5 points (-110)**
