Despite a last-minute postponement between the Denver Nuggets and Detroit Pistons, it was an exciting Monday night in the NBA. There were game-winners, two Balls in the starting lineup across the league, and a Cavaliers center putting up a monster stat line.

It was another great night of hoops.

Booker for the Win!
-------------------

As the Dallas Mavericks choked away yet another game, they did so at the mercy of Phoenix's Devin Booker. Always known for his clutch-shot making ability, Booker just did it again.

He knocked in a 25-footer to give the Suns a one-point lead with inside of 1.5 seconds left in the ballgame on Monday. Phoenix had struggled in his absence, so this performance was just what the team needed.

The Suns were a bit short-handed, with several key reserves out of the lineup, but the team was still able to get it done. Perhaps the most surprising thing was the final stat line of Chris Paul.

He finished with 34 points, nine rebounds and nine assists. To think that he's now in year 17, still putting up this production as a 6-foot point guard is unbelievable.

Every night, it seems Booker is finding another way to help his team win. He's getting buckets for much of the game. He's making the right pass.

And now, he's back to delivering winners. He hit an incredible one against the Clippers in the bubble last season, and now he's doing it in arenas again. You love to see it.

Allen Explodes in First Cavs Start
----------------------------------

Any Cleveland Cavaliers fans that worried that not having Andre Drummond in the lineup would lead to a defeat against Minnesota were pleasantly surprised at the result of the team's game on Monday.

Jarrett Allen, making his first start since being acquired by the Cavaliers in the massive James Harden trade, put up 23 points, 18 rebounds and five blocks. He is the first Cavaliers player since Andrew Bynum in 2013 with a 20-point, 10-rebound, five-block effort.

Allen hit seven of his nine shot attempts while making nine shots from the free-throw line. He isn't built as big as Drummond is, but he uses his long frame to clear boards for his team.

This isn't all that surprising, given some of the performances Allen had during his three-plus seasons with Brooklyn. The future in Cleveland is very bright, with Darius Garland, Collin Sexton and Allen all being younger than 23 years of age.

Monk Goes Off
-------------

Charlotte's Malik Monk has been labeled by many as a bust. Taken with the No. 11 pick in 2017, he has never been able to carve out a consistent role or make winning plays.

He does have a game-winner to his name, but his efforts Monday night may have shown that he has a lot to offer when given a chance.

The Hornets played without Terry Rozier Monday night, allowing LaMelo Ball to make his first start. It also gave way to Monk being able to play huge minutes.

Monk shot 11-of-18 from the floor, including 9-of-13 from three-point land. He finished the game with 36 points and five rebounds overall.

This could be a sign of things to come for the Hornets guard, who is still extremely young, as Monk will celebrate his 23rd birthday on Thursday.
