Two teams **climbing the ranks** in their respective conferences meet on Friday night in Chicago when the Phoenix Suns battle the Chicago Bulls. This is the first meeting of the season for the two sides, with the Suns winning last year’s only contest.

The Suns begin a mini three-game road trip for the week that ends with games at Minnesota and Los Angeles (Lakers). Let’s find the **best play** for Friday night’s game.

Phoenix Suns
------------

Prior to the loss on Wednesday against Charlotte, the Suns were winners of 12 of their previous 14 games. That outstanding stretch has **vaulted them** into the top half of the playoff picture in the West. At 20-11, they are in the #4 seed and a game-and-a-half outside of the #2 spot.

One of the biggest NBA stories this week covered the snubbing of should-be All-Star Devin Booker. The sixth-year guard was **primed to be named** to his second All-Star team in a row but was left off the roster in a loaded Western Conference. Booker is averaging 25.0 PPG and a career-best 50% from the field.

Chris Paul has continued his **excellent form** in his first season in Phoenix (6+ assists in eight straight games), and Deandre Ayton is averaging a double-double with a career-best 59.4% FG.

Chicago Bulls
-------------

The Bulls have surged up the Eastern Conference standings with five wins in their last six games. The conference is **so tight** that at 15-16, they are in a four-way tie for the #5 seed. They are a half-game back of the #4 seed, and there are eight teams separated by 2.5 games between the #4 and #11 spots.

Head Coach Billy Donovan has **established a culture** in Chicago. Zach LaVine is the team’s first All-Star since 2017, and Thaddeus Young is playing his best basketball. Young has become the team’s Swiss-Army Knife by doing what is required on any given night. He is spending 30% of his time at the center position, a career-high. Over the last seven games, Young is averaging 13.1 points, 7.0 rebounds, 4.5 assists, and 1.8 steals + blocks per game.

If there is a knock on Chicago’s recent run, it is that four of the five wins were **against very bad teams**. They started with a good win against Indiana, but the other four were against Detroit (last in the East), Sacramento & Houston (BOTH on nine-game losing streaks), and Minnesota (last in West, needed OT to win).

What to wager
-------------

The Suns roll into Chicago as 5.5-point favorites with the over / under set at 229. Though the Bulls have played better as of late, they are still 1-6 this season against top-8 Western Conference teams. Five of those seven games have been decided by one possession, so both sides of the spread **appear suspect** to me.

Ever since the Bulls held Orlando to 92 points in early February, they have committed themselves to team defense. I expect the Suns’ top-4 defense to slow this game down, and the Bulls will have to adjust. I’ll **take the under**.

**The Pick: Under 229 (-110)**
