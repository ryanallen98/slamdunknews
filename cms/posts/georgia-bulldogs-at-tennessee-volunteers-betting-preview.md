It’s a showdown in the SEC as the Georgia Bulldogs (12-6, 5-6 SEC) are in Knoxville to take on the Tennessee Volunteers (13-4, 6-4 SEC) Wednesday night inside Thompson-Boling Arena. Tip-off is at 8:00 P.M. Eastern.

Initially, the Bulldogs were scheduled to play Texas A&M while the Volunteers were set to tip off with Florida, but both matchups were postponed due to COVID-19 concerns. Georgia and Tennessee will meet for the first and only time this regular season.

Both programs are fighting for conference positioning coming down the home stretch. Alabama has been running away with the SEC, while eight teams are separated by just two games vying for second place, including Georgia and Tennessee.

Georgia Bulldogs Outlook
------------------------

Georgia’s season has consisted of five separate streaks up to this juncture. They began the year with seven straight wins, lost their next four, won two, lost two, and are now riding a three-game winning streak heading into this battle with Tennessee. The Bulldogs are in their toughest stretch of the season and one that could make or break their tournament hopes.

After Wednesday’s contest with No. 16 Tennessee, Georgia will go on the road to face the Crimson Tide on Saturday and then back home to host the No. 19 Missouri Tigers. It's a tall task for the Bulldogs, who have yet to face a ranked team all year.

Georgia has four players averaging double-figures, led by Sahvir Wheeler’s 13.6 points per game. The sophomore guard also leads the team in minutes and assists.

Tennessee Volunteers Outlook
----------------------------

Just like their opponent on Wednesday, Tennessee started the year 7-0, bouncing in and out of the Top 10 since they began the season ranked No. 12. Most recently, the Vols rallied past Kentucky on Saturday night to earn their second straight victory inside Rupp Arena and sixth out of their last nine against the Wildcats overall.

Tennessee has now won three out of their last four, with the only hiccup coming in Oxford last Tuesday when they let an 11-point lead slip away against Ole Miss. That letdown allowed the Rebels to pick up their first win against a ranked opponent in more than two years, but Tennessee responded four days later with the win over Kentucky.

UT also has four players in double-digit points, but none of them score more than 10.5 points per game. Interestingly, Santiago Vescovi plays the most minutes but ranks seventh on the team in scoring.

Betting Line and Pick
---------------------

Tennessee is favored by 12.5 in this one with an over/under of 140.5. Georgia is 9-8 ATS this season and 3-2 on the road, while UT is 10-7 ATS and 7-5 at Thompson-Boling Arena. As a double-digit favorite this year, Tennessee is 6-1 SU and 5-2 ATS, only losing outright to Alabama as 10.5-point home favorites on January 2.

The 12.5-point spread will be the most points the Bulldogs have caught all season, though they are 3-1 ATS as an underdog of eight points or more.

Wednesday's game comes down to which team can pivot strategies the quickest after the scheduling change, and that will be the Volunteers who are the superior team. Tennessee is also looking for revenge after last year’s 17-point road loss.

**Betting Pick: Tennessee Volunteers (-12.5).**
