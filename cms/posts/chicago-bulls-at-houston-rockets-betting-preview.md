Basketball returns to Texas on Monday night when the Houston Rockets host the Chicago Bulls. The last time any team from Texas took the court in their home state was over a week ago in Dallas. The Rockets have not played a home game since February 12. They will look to use their home court to **curb their seven-game losing streak**.

This is the **second time** these two teams have met this year. The Bulls notched a 125-120 win in Chicago in Mid-January. Victor Oladipo scored 32 points in his team debut after being acquired via trade, but Zach LaVine’s 33 led the way for Chicago.

The second meeting will look a lot different from a personnel standpoint, as both teams **deal with injuries**. Let’s take a look at the state of both teams before finding the right bet.

Chicago Bulls
-------------

At 13-16, the Bulls continue to **stay competitive on most nights**. They took the 76ers down to the final few minutes before Philly pulled away thanks to 50 points from Joel Embiid. Chicago bounced back nicely on Saturday night with a win over Sacramento.

Zach LaVine has scored 20+ points in 16 straight games and 30+ in seven of the last eight. He is primed to be named the Bulls’ **first All-Star since Jimmy Butler** in 2017. They have needed LaVine with Lauri Markkanen still out. Coby White and Thaddeus Young have both stepped up in Markkanen’s absence.

Having won four of their last six games, the Bulls have quietly **nestled into the playoff mix**. They are just a game back of the eighth seed. Though they have five teams in front of them, they are just two games removed from the four seed in what is turning into a wide-open Eastern Conference.

Houston Rockets
---------------

All teams hit rough patches throughout an NBA season, whether it be injuries, bad form, bad luck, or any combination thereof. The Rockets appear to have **hit a bad stretch of all three**. The team had won six in a row in late January but are now dealing with seven consecutive losses.

The current streak is the **longest** for the franchise since January of 2013. That was the first season James Harden appeared in Houston. For reference, the second-leading scorer for Houston the night of their seventh loss was Carlos Delfino, and the game’s leading scorer was Minnesota’s Andrei Kirilenko.

Back to 2021, Houston finds themselves at 11-17 and **second from the bottom** in the West. Christian Wood remains week-to-week with an ankle sprain, and Victor Oladipo has missed three games with foot soreness. DeMarcus Cousins is dealing with heel soreness. Cousins is questionable, while Oladipo is doubtful for Monday night.

If there is a bright spot for the Rockets, it is that John Wall is **playing his best basketball** in years. The #1 overall pick from 2010 has led the team in scoring in seven out of the last eight games and scored 20 or more in five out of six. He has not accomplished that since the Wizards’ 2018 playoff series against Toronto.

What to wager
-------------

The Rockets should not be considered favorites in this matchup. They are battered by injuries, and the Bulls have hit good form against middling teams. Chicago’s two losses over their last six games have come against the Clippers and 76ers. I will happily **grab the Bulls on the moneyline at -106**.

**The Pick: Bulls ML (-106)**
