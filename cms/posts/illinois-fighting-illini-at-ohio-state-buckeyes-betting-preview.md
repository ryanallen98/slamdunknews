The biggest matchup on the Saturday card belongs to the Big Ten as the Illinois Fighting Illini (19-6, 15-4 Big Ten) are in Columbus to **battle** the Ohio State Buckeyes (18-7, 12-7 Big Ten) on Saturday. Tip-off from Value City Arena is set for 4:00pm EST on ESPN.

This is the **only meeting** between two teams ranked in the Top 10 on Saturday as Illinois enters as the 4th-ranked team in the country and Ohio State comes in at No. 7. The Buckeyes took the first contest back on January 16 by seven in Champaign.

ILLINOIS OUTLOOK
----------------

The Illini have **ascended to that 4th spot** in the national rankings and a potential 1-seed in the NCAA Tournament on the heels of a three-game winning streak and coming out on top in 10 of their last 11 overall. Perhaps even more impressive is winning three in a row without their best player.

Ayo Dosunmu broke his nose in the team’s loss to Michigan State on February 23 and **has not played since**. However, Kofi Cockburn, Andre Curbelo, and Trent Frazier have all stepped up in his absence, leading the team to wins over Nebraska, Wisconsin, and Michigan.

Dosunmu, who was **recently named Naismith Trophy semifinalist** (one of three players from the Big Ten), is still considered day-to-day, and we may not know his status for this Ohio State game until right before tip-off. There was hope he would have played against the Wolverines, but he was pulled minutes before the game began.

OHIO STATE OUTLOOK
------------------

The Buckeyes, meanwhile, have been going in the opposite direction. This time last week, Ohio State was ranked 4th in the country but are in the midst of a **three-game slide** that saw them come out on the wrong end of games against Michigan, Michigan State, and Iowa. Prior to the skid, OSU won seven in a row but now have not played since that loss to the Hawkeyes last Sunday.

E.J. Lidell **leads the team** in scoring, rebounding, and blocked shots, pouring in 26 points in the first matchup between the two schools and grabbing seven rebounds.

BETTING LINE AND PICK
---------------------

Ohio State is favored by 2 in this Big Ten battle, with an over/under of 151. Illinois was a 7-point favorite the first time around, with the Buckeyes **winning outright** and the 168 combined points going well OVER the posted total of 145.

This is the **regular-season finale** for both programs as they prepare for the Big Ten Tournament next week. If Illinois wins, they could be propelled into the top spot and then wait to see the result of the Michigan/Michigan State game on Sunday. The Buckeyes could leapfrog Purdue depending on the Boilermakers’ outcome with Indiana, and then both would wait for Iowa’s matchup on Sunday as well.

Illinois has proven they can win without Dosunmu, but Ohio State has more to prove in this one. **Take the home team and then buckle up** for what will be a wild ride in the conference tournament next week.

**Pick: Ohio State -2**
