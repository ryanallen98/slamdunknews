Day 2 of the **NCAA Tournament** features another First Round matchup pitting the 9-seed **Missouri Tigers (16-9)** from the SEC against the 8-seed **Oklahoma Sooners (15-10)** out of the Big 12 in the West Region. Tip-off on Saturday from Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis is set for 7:25pm EST on TNT. These two schools actually squared off in the regular season last year, with the Sooners winning a neutral-site November tilt in Kansas City, but this will mark the first time the two programs will meet in the Big Dance.

Missouri Outlook
----------------

The **Tigers earned the 9th seed after finishing 7th in the SEC**, winning their second-round matchup over Georgia in the conference tournament before ultimately bowing out to Arkansas in the quarterfinals last Friday.

During the regular season, **Missouri faced five ranked opponents and finished 4-1** in those contests, including non-conference wins over Illinois and Oregon. The Tigers, themselves, climbed as high as the No. 10 team in the country in the second week of February but dropped four out of their next five and never sniffed the Top 25 again.

Led by guards **Xavier Pinson** and **Dru Smith**, the Tigers are looking to advance to the second weekend of the NCAA Tournament for the first time since 2009.

Oklahoma Outlook
----------------

The **Sooners are the West’s 8-seed thanks to a 6th place finish in the Big 12**, then bowing out in the conference tournament quarterfinals to Kansas before the Jayhawks withdrew due to positive COVID-19 tests.

**Oklahoma faltered down the stretch of the regular season, losing their final four games**, including a loss to Texas and a home-and-home sweep at the hands of Oklahoma State. The Sooners also tasted Top-10 success, getting as high as No. 7 in the polls but finished out as the 25th-ranked team in the land.

The big story to come out of Norman this past week was the fact that the **team will be without De’Vion Harman** after the sophomore guard tested positive for COVID-19. Harman, the team’s second-leading scorer, will miss the entire first weekend should OU continue advancing and wouldn’t be available until the Sweet 16. That means Austin Reaves, the Big 12’s second-leading scorer, will have to pick up even more of the offensive burden.

Betting Line and Pick
---------------------

The **Harman news did not have a major impact on the spread**, as this game opened with the Sooners favored by two, and it now sits at Oklahoma -1 with an over/under of 139.5. Both teams had identical 12-13 records ATS this year, with both going 4-6 SU in their last 10.

**Take a look at the OVER in this one** as it's 10-2 in the Tigers' last 12 NCAA Tournament games as an underdog and 9-3 in the Sooners last 12 NCAA tourney games as a favorite.

**Harman being out should be looked at as a big blow to Oklahoma**, but the books don’t see it that way, and assuming Reaves can continue his streak of 11 consecutive double-digit games, the Sooners will move on, likely to face Gonzaga in the Round of 32.

**Pick**: Oklahoma -1
