With a 105-98 victory over the Phoenix Suns, Giannis Antetokounmpo scored 50 points to lead the Milwaukee Bucks to their first NBA title in 50 years.

‍

The Bucks' 4-2 series victory was celebrated in front of a 17,000-strong throng outside the Fiserv Forum. After losing their first two matches, they are only the sixth team to win the best-of-seven finals series.

"I'm happy I was able to do it with this team for Milwaukee," said Antetokounmpo.

‍

The Suns were looking for their first NBA title in 53 years, after losing NBA Finals series in 1976 and 1993. They were unable to contain Antetokounmpo, who became only the seventh player in Final’s history to score 50 points.

‍

Unlike the 2020 NBA Finals, which were held without spectators, the Bucks' victory sparked a raucous celebration both within the arena and on Milwaukee's streets.

‍

More than a tenth of the city's population congregated outside Fiserv Forum in the Deer District, with some supporters waiting in line for up to five hours before the game to assure a seat.
