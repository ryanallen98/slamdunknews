Thursday night brings the return of several teams following a week-long layoff for the NBA’s All-Star Break. One of the best matchups of the night features two playoff teams in the Western Conference when the Golden State Warriors take on the Los Angeles Clippers at the Staples Center.

This is the **final meeting** between these teams in the regular season. The two sides met for a two-game series in San Francisco on January 7th and 9th, where they split the series.

Both teams are **resuming play on the heels of three consecutive losses**. Neither team had lost three straight all year, and one team will fall for the fourth time in a row. Let’s look at this matchup to find the best value play for your Thursday night entertainment.

Golden State Warriors
---------------------

If the regular season ended today, Golden State would still be playing postseason basketball, but barely. They are **right on the cusp** of the top eight seeds and will be looking to make a second-half run to avoid any play-in scenarios.

Rumors have begun to swirl about the Warriors looking to add another guard at the trade deadline. Victor Oladipo’s name has been thrown out there, but the Dubs will need to be careful at a time when the **future of the franchise** beyond 2021 is anything but clear.

Golden State has been **consistently inconsistent** this year. Prior to their final six games before the break, they had not won OR lost more than two games in a row all year. What followed was a three-game win streak AND their three-game losing streak.

There is a real possibility that the current losing streak could balloon to six games. The team has **struggled this season** against opponents over .500, going 7-12. That does not bode well for the next week with the Jazz and Lakers due up after this game.

Los Angeles Clippers
--------------------

The Clippers were in great form following a four-game win streak in mid-February. The lead-in to the All-Star Break provided their first slump of the season. The team has lost six of their last nine games and looking to snap their current three-game skid.

Despite the squad being fully healthy, it is the **declining scoring** of Paul George that has been most concerning in the recent weeks. George has four games of 16 points or fewer in his last seven. With few other bulk scoring options on the Los Angeles bench, George needs to provide more for his team to compete each night.

One of those other usual scoring options is Lou Williams off the bench. His scoring averages have plummeted this year after four straight seasons of 18+ points per game. His 12.5 PPG is the lowest output for the veteran since 2013-14.

What to wager
-------------

The Clippers are listed as 7.5-point favorites, with the total set at 231.5. With both teams on a three-game losing streak, it is **hard to pinpoint who will bounce back** first and by how many points.

I am looking more closely at the total where we see that the Warriors have stayed under 232 in six of the last seven games. The Clippers have done the same in their last seven games against teams with a .500 record or better, meaning they **lock it in against the good teams**.

I’ll put my **money down on the under**, giving myself plenty of wiggle room.

‍

**The Pick: Under 231.5 (-110)**
