Just like Kevin Durant, LeBron was able to draft his own team from the pool of players. This was the fourth year in a row that the NBA has done away with the East vs. West format and instead opted to give the player with the most votes from each conference the **opportunity to be a captain**. Let’s meet Bron’s squad.

The Starters
------------

Of course, LeBron himself is the first starter here. KD had to draft five guys because he isn’t going to be playing. So the King is back in the All-Star game yet again, a place he has come to find himself in **each and every year**.

LeBron made sure to take **Giannis right off the bat** to provide some size and strong finishing ability. He can also defend as well as any player in the league, as noted by his DPOY award in 2020.

Stephen Curry followed, and he will be magic on the team, making practically every shot he takes. After playing just five games last season, Steph has **had quite the triumphant return** to glory in 2021.

Luka Doncic joins them as another player that can make **something out of nothing** on almost every possession. The team is topped off by Nikola Jokic, who will be an MVP finalist when all is said and done. Denver’s record versus Philly’s record might be the ultimate deciding factor.

Curry-Doncic-James-Giannis-Jokic is a pretty **stacked five**.

The Reserves
------------

LeBron made sure that Chris Paul ended up on his team. He is the only other “Banana Boat” member in the All-Star game, so he had to get his buddy to join. D-Wade is retired, and Carmelo will **likely not see another appearance** in the game for the rest of his career.

Jaylen Brown and Paul George are going to be here as well, getting buckets and **playing some terrific perimeter defense** on the opposite side. LeBron joked that this would be the one time he would do anything with PG, as the two are rivals, with George playing for the Clippers and all.

Ben Simmons and Damian Lillard will be playing the backup guard minutes off the bench. Simmons is having another incredible season, while Lillard might finally have etched his name into the MVP conversation. He has a very slim chance of winning, but to see him getting some **deserved recognition** has been terrific.

At the big man position, LeBron drafted Domantas Sabonis because “he needed size.” He did this knowing that Rudy Gobert was also on the board. LeBron was **not showing a ton of respect** for the 27-9 Jazz and their starting center. After Durant opted to draft Donovan Mitchell, Rudy still ended up on Team LeBron. James said, “no disrespect, but we didn’t play as the Utah Jazz in video games growing up.”

Rudy **probably felt slighted** and will perform when given the minutes on Sunday. It does help that the team’s coach is his own, Quin Snyder. But, poor Rudy. Put some respect on The Big Baguette’s name.

Team LeBron is stacked, and it will be **fun to watch** Team Durant try and stop them.
