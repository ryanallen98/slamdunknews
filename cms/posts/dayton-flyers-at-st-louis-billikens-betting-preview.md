The Dayton Flyers will visit Chaifetz Arena in St. Louis, Missouri, Tuesday night to take on the #22nd ranked Billikens. The opening tip is set for 8:00 PM ET. St. Louis University has not played a game since December 23rd due to a COVID-19 outbreak that put the program on pause. SLU is currently a nine-point favorite in the game, and the over/under is 134.5. Expect defense and rebounding to rule the night.

Dayton Betting Preview: Time to Get Hot in Conference Play
----------------------------------------------------------

The Dayton Flyers come into play with a 9-4 record and 4-3 in Atlantic-10 play. The Flyers are 2-2 on the road this season and will be looking for a signature win in conference play. Dayton last played on Saturday and did not fare well at VCU. The Flyers managed to score just 43 points in the 23-point loss. The first half was especially bad, where the Flyers managed to score only 13 points, which was a season-low. Dayton shot just 31% for the game, including going just 3-20 from three-point range. The Flyers converted only 17 field goals in the game, and the offense was never in sync. Center Jordy Tshimanga led the Flyers with 10 points and five rebounds. Leading scorer Jalen Crutcher was held to just four points on 2-7 shooting. Guard Ibi Watson, who averages 15 points per game, was held to only five on 2-10 shooting.

Crutcher leads the Flyers with a scoring average of 18.2 points and 4.4 assists per game on the season. Tshimanga leads the team in rebounding, averaging 7.8 rebounds per game for a Flyers team that averages 31.5 rebounds per contest.

St. Louis Betting Preview: Knock the Rust Off
---------------------------------------------

The St. Louis Billikens come into play with a record of 7-1. They are ranked 22nd in the latest AP poll. The Billikens have not played a conference game yet. They also have not played since December 23rd, when they beat the University of Missouri at Kansas City by 16 points. SLU has gained signature wins over North Carolina State and LSU, while their only loss was to Minnesota, who is ranked #21 in the country. The Billikens are led by their seniors: Jordan Goodwin, Hassan French, Javonte Perkins, and Josh Hightower. Goodwin was nominated for the Jerry West Award at the beginning of the season, given to the nation’s top shooting guard. Goodwin is one of the best rebounding guards in the country, especially on the offensive end.

Perkins leads the Billikens in scoring, averaging 17.8 points per game. Goodwin’s rebounding prowess is proven by the numbers, as he is averaging 16.9 points and leads the team with 11.1 rebounds per game. French is a force down low, averaging nearly two blocks per game.

Betting Lines and Predictions
-----------------------------

The spread on this game is St. Louis -9. However, for a team that has not played in over a month and has only been practicing for three days, a rust period is expected, especially on the offensive end. The caveat is that St. Louis is one of the best defensive teams in the country, and Dayton struggles offensively. This combination will help SLU win but take Dayton to cover.

**Pick: Dayton +9**
