The **Milwaukee Bucks and Washington Wizards** meet for the first of two games in three nights in DC on Saturday night. This is the first of three meetings between the two sides this year. Their first scheduled matchup on January 23 was postponed, the last of six games the Wizards missed due to Covid issues.

The **Wizards** will already be playing their third game since the All-Star Break, while the Bucks will aim to climb to ten games over .500 for the first time this year.

Let’s dive into this mini-series in **Washington** to find the best value play for the night.

Milwaukee Bucks
---------------

As a top team in the East, the **Bucks** are expected to easily dispatch the lower tier teams in the conference. They have executed that narrative just about all season long.

As of the current day standings, the team has just two losses all season to an **Eastern Conference** foe with a sub-.500 record. Those losses both came to Toronto in the span of three nights about a month ago. Milwaukee is 10-2 this year against the lesser teams in the East.

**Giannis Antetokounmpo** took home the All-Star Game MVP award last Sunday night with his perfect 16-for-16 shooting performance. He has continued to be an outstanding leader in Milwaukee, pacing the squad in points and rebounds for 17 straight games.

In their 131-101 win over the **Knicks** on Thursday, Bryn Forbes was the surprise second-leading scorer with 21 points (7/7 3FG) off the bench. It was another easy win as all five Bucks’ starters registered a +21 plus / minus or better.

Washington Wizards
------------------

**Washington’s** brutal 6-17 start to the season put them in a deep hole. They responded nicely with seven wins in eight games. With just three wins over their last eight, however, this team is going to have to work really hard to finish as a .500 team.

**Bradley Beal** has taken on his All-Star responsibilities, while Russell Westbrook continues to distribute. Beal’s short night in a 127-101 loss to the 76ers on Friday snapped a string of 16 straight games with at least 20 points.

**Westbrook is up to his old statistical antics**. The 13-year veteran finished February with five triple-doubles in seven games. That streak would have stretched to nine straight games if he hadn’t gotten stuck on nine rebounds or assists in the surrounding four contests.

Despite losing four of their last five, the Wizards can be hard to read on any given night. **That one win came against the Clippers**. They have also beaten the Lakers, Nets (twice), Nuggets (twice), and Suns this year.

What to wager
-------------

The **Bucks are 10.5-point favorites** and with good reason. When the Wizards lose, they lose badly. Thirteen of Washington’s last 14 losses have been by at least 11 points.

That is enough proof for me to take the Bucks without any hesitation. **I expect Milwaukee to win this game by double digits**.

**The Pick**: Bucks -10.5 (-110)
