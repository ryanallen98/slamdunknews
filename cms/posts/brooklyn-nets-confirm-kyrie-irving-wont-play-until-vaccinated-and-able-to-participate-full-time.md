Kyrie Irving, the standout player for the Brooklyn Nets, has declared that he will neither play nor train with the team until he has been vaccinated. 

 

Irving is currently ineligible for all Brooklyn Nets home games, but he was anticipated to contribute in some way this season. Sean Marks, the team's general manager, has now stated that Irving will not be playing or practising with the team.

 

Unvaccinated individuals are forbidden from working in or attending events at many indoor places in New York because to the Covid-19 rule. NBA players, for example, are not permitted to practise in the city or play home games for the New York Knicks or Brooklyn Nets unless they have gotten and have documentation of at least one Covid-19 immunisation shot.

 

San Francisco has similar laws, which will take effect on November 29 in Los Angeles. Andrew Wiggins, a Golden State Warriors max contract player, first asked for a religious exemption from the vaccine so that he may play home games at Chase Centre. The league, however, turned down his appeal, and Wiggins eventually decided to get vaccinated against Covid-19.

 

Irving has made it plain that he does not want to get the vaccine, and his teammates Kevin Durant and James Harden have protected him thus far. However, both have stated that they want him on the court to begin the season, which begins on October 19 with the Brooklyn Nets against the reigning NBA champion Milwaukee Bucks on Sky Sports.

 

In a statement, Brooklyn Nets General Marks said: "Given the evolving nature of the situation and after thorough deliberation, we have decided Kyrie Irving will not play or practice with the team until he is eligible to be a full participant."

 

The NBA does not require players to be vaccinated, but there are stringent penalties for those who refuse. Irving will lose about $381,000 each game because of the league and players association agreeing to a pay cut equivalent to 1/91.6 of an individual's salary for each game missed due to local market vaccine restrictions. 

 

So far, more than 95% of NBA players have been vaccinated.
