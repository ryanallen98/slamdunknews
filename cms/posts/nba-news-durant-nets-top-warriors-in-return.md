Saturday night in the NBA featured just five games, though there are always headlines. That is the beauty of the **best basketball league** in the entire world.

Continue reading for **a recap of the evening**.

Nets Defeat Warriors in Durant's Return
---------------------------------------

After missing another week of action, Kevin Durant returned to the Brooklyn Nets' lineup to help **guide the team to a win** over the Warriors. It was not just another game for him, though, as there is no question that this one was personal.

He **spent three years with Golden State**, winning two titles, and wanted to prove in his return against them that he was now better off without them.

Durant was one of six Nets to score 15 or more points as the team put up an impressive 134 against the Warriors. He blocked a couple of shots, **finishing with 20 points**, five rebounds, six assists and four turnovers in 33 minutes of action.

The team was playing without DeAndre Jordan, so it **opted to just stay small** the entire game to match their opponents.

Stephen Curry **shot the ball just 17 times**, making 10 of them, including all eight of his tries from inside of the arc. Golden State shooting 9-of-34 from three-point range was one of several reasons as to why it fell short, as it appeared the Warriors were just overmatched for much of the game.

Brooklyn has **the No. 1 offense in the NBA** for a reason, after all.

Short-Handed Rockets Fall to Knicks
-----------------------------------

Since Christian Wood got hurt, the entire Rockets world has unraveled. They looked like one of the best teams in the league when he was playing for the previous few weeks, but the team has now **gone 0-5 in his absence**.

Victor Oladipo is currently injured as well, so the Rockets are basically playing **without two high-impact players**. This leaves it to John Wall and the role players to try and lead them, and they just lost another one.

Julius Randle and Immanuel Quickley scored 22 points apiece to **lift the Knicks past Houston** by a 121-99 score. New York hasn't been getting much out of RJ Barrett, though it really hasn't needed to.

Since Derrick Rose joined the team, the bench has looked better than that of any other team in the league. Obi Toppin finally had **an impactful performance**, finishing with 11 points, three rebounds and a block off the bench.

If it can stay healthy, Houston would make **a very intriguing matchup** for any team in the NBA. New York does appear to be a playoff team this year, likely ending up in the seven to 10 range and in the play-in bracket.

Utah Easily Beats The Heat
--------------------------

The Jazz **shot 12-of-46 from three-point range** against Miami on Saturday night. Yet they played well enough to be able to send in the subs for the final couple of minutes, beating the Heat, 112-94.

Utah is a team that has gone undefeated without Mike Conley, who had been having a very good season. The Jazz **are now 22-5** and continue to be the surprise of the league.

Donovan Mitchell **led the way with 26 points**, while Rudy Gobert added 16 points, 12 rebounds and three blocks. Royce O'Neale guided the defense with three steals and three blocks.

This loss **dropped Miami to 11-15**.
