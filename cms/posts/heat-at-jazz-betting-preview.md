Two **winning streaks collide** on Saturday night when the Miami Heat visit the Utah Jazz in Salt Lake City. The Heat have won four in a row, while the Jazz picked up their sixth consecutive victory (and 17th of 18) last night. This is the first meeting of the season between the two sides.

Miami now looks **resurgent** in a difficult eastern conference, and Utah sits atop the west with a half-game lead on the Lakers. Let’s take a look at this matchup and find the value.

Miami Heat
----------

What can this team accomplish when entirely **healthy**? We have yet to find out this season since the team has been dealing with both Covid and injury issues all year. At 11-14, the Heat are far from their finals run of just six months ago, but there is hope on the horizon.

The injury situation isn’t great. Goran Dragic has **missed three games and is questionable** against Utah. Tyler Herro missed Thursday’s tilt in Houston, and Meyers Leonard is out for the year after undergoing surgery on his shoulder.

Jimmy Butler missed ten games in January, but the team is now **5-2 since his return**. Their four-game win streak should be encouraging since the team didn’t have a streak of more than TWO wins yet this season.

In addition to Butler, Kendrick Nunn is back to **scoring like he did his rookie year**. After missing three games, the second-year guard is averaging 17 points over the last four games in an extended role.

Utah Jazz
---------

No team is hotter than the Utah Jazz. There is so much with which to be impressed inside their **17 wins over their last 18** games. In their 17 wins, the Jazz have had five different leading scorers.

Donovan Mitchell is **averaging 29 points** over his last four games. His assist numbers are up as well, recording 8 or more in each of the last three. Rudy Gobert’s 27 points on Friday night against Milwaukee was two points off his season-high.

Much of the Jazz’s recent success is due to the **elevated play** of Bojan Bogdanovic. After a brutal shooting start to the season, the Croatian is back to doing what is expected of him.

Bogdanovic is supposed to be the reliable scoring option off the bench, but during the first 18 games of the year, he only had two games of more than 20 points. He also shot worse than 37% in 12 of those games. In the last eight games, however, he has **eclipsed 20 points** four times and shot 50% or better on five occasions.

The Jazz will likely be without Mike Conley, who has **missed the last three games** with hamstring tightness

What to wager
-------------

Given the events of the first half of the season, this matchup appears more lopsided than in reality. The Heat are starting to work back into form. The Jazz are formidable but are on the back end of a back-to-back. Utah **only has five losses** this year, and the last two have been the second game of a back-to-back.

Through the injuries, Miami stays true to who they are, a defensive-minded squad. Both teams currently **rank top six** in points allowed per game.

I would really love to take the Heat on the moneyline here, but with all their injuries, getting +175 isn’t enough value for me. I would reconsider if the number geared closer to +200. With Utah fatigued and Jimmy Butler’s commitment to defense, I am happy to **bank the under at 217.5**.

**The Pick: Under 217.5 (-109)**
