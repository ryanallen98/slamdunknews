Kevin Durant. Anthony Davis. Joel Embiid. MVP-caliber players who, instead, are now highlighting the NBA's injury report. Their teams are **staying afloat** in their absences, sitting at or near the top of their respective conferences, but with the trade deadline approaching, anything can happen in the next couple of weeks.

The **buyout market** has taken shape as well, one that also includes some high-profile names like LaMarcus Aldridge and Andre Drummond. The Nets already agreed to terms with Blake Griffin, who was bought out by the Nets and are one of the rumored short-listed teams to land Drummond too.

There's no shortage of drama in the NBA, so let's take a look at some additional injury news that materialized at the beginning of the week.

MARVIN BAGLEY FRACTURES HAND
----------------------------

Bagley, along with several of his teammates, has been the topic of trade rumors as well as the Kings currently sit in 13th in the Western Conference. The third-year big man from Duke will likely stay put after fracturing his hand in the team's loss to the Hornets on Monday.

The Kings announced that an X-ray was taken at the Spectrum Center after the game confirmed Bagley **sustained a fracture** of the fourth metacarpal in his left hand. The 22-year old will undergo further medical evaluation, and an update on his status and recovery time will be released later this week. Currently, it still remains unclear how he injured the hand. Bagley only played in 13 games last year due to various injuries, including a broken thumb.

CJ MCCOLLUM SET TO RETURN
-------------------------

In some more positive news, the Blazers expect CJ McCollum to return to the lineup on Tuesday against the Pelicans. The shooting guard has not played since January 16, when he fractured his foot against the Hawks. This was the third time he's endured a fractured foot since entering the league, so **caution was at the forefront** of his mind this time around.

> "I'm coming off my third fracture. I have to be smart and patient. I needed to see how my foot would respond to contact," he said. "People assume you get cleared and just go back to playing, not realizing I couldn't run for seven weeks. Conditioning comes from playing. I can't just run on the treadmill or bike and simulate the force you put through your foot and body."

The Blazers have **stayed in contention** in his absence, going 14-10 without the 29-year old, and find themselves in sixth in the West, just a half-game behind the Nuggets. McCollum was on pace for an All-Star nod prior to the injury, averaging 26.7 points and five assists per game while shooting 44.1 percent from 3-point land -- all of which are career-highs.

Portland has been **unlucky in the injury department** this year, also losing Jusuf Nurkic and Zach Collins for the majority of the season, both of whom are also expected to return later in the second half of the season. No word yet on if McCollum will be under a minutes restriction against New Orleans.
