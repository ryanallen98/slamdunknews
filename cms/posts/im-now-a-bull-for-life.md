Joakim Noah was appointed a team ambassador by the Bulls just hours before he was to be honoured by the team.

 

Joakim Noah began his NBA career with the Chicago Bulls, where he had some of his most memorable moments. On Thursday, the Bulls confirmed that he will remain with the team in the future.

 

Noah was designated a Bulls ambassador and will be honoured before the team's home game against the New York Knicks on Thursday. Noah was a three-time All-Defensive selection and spent nine of his 13 seasons with the Bulls (2007-16). He was the No. 9 overall choice in the 2007 Draft. In 2013-14, he was selected both Kia Defensive Player of the Year and to the All-NBA first team, which was his crowning achievement.

 

“I’m truly humbled to be honored by both the team and city that I have always loved and respected,” Noah said in a statement released by the team. 

 

“It means so much to me that I’m now a Bull for life. I love you all and am thrilled tonight to solidify my continued connection with the Bulls and the city of Chicago, in this new chapter of my life.”

 

Noah will engage with the group as an ambassador to create ties with individuals all throughout Chicago, and the Bulls will donate to his charity, the Noah's Arc Foundation, on an annual basis. Noah last appeared in the NBA during the 2019-20 season for the Los Angeles Clippers, participating in five games. He formerly played for the New York Knicks (2016-18) and Memphis Grizzlies (2018-19).

 

Noah averaged 9.3 points, 9.4 rebounds, 3.0 assists, and 1.4 blocks per game in 572 regular-season games with Chicago. He was a key member of the Bulls' postseason teams in the late 2000s and early 2010s, averaging 9.7 points per game, 11.0 rebounds per game, 2.8 assists per game, and 1.7 blocks per game in 60 playoff games.
