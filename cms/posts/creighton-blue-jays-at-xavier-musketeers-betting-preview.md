It’s a Big East showdown on Saturday as the No. 13 Creighton Blue Jays (17-5, 13-4) take on the Xavier Musketeers (12-5, 5-5) in the Cintas Center in Cincinnati. Tip-off is set for 5:00 PM EST.  

The last time these two met was December 23rd, 2020 where the Blue Jays took the win on home court, 66-61.

Creighton Blue Jays Outlook
---------------------------

The Blue Jays are currently **eyeing the Big East title** as they sit two games behind Villanova with only three games left to play, including a trip to Villanova next week. The Blue are in the top 20 NCAA teams this season for finishing at the rim, with a team average of shooting 48% from the field.

The Blue Jays have one of the **best cohesive teams** in the NCAA currently, with a playstyle focused on three-point shots opening lanes to the rim. Junior Guard Marcus Zegarowski leads the Blue Jays in points per game with an average of 14.9 points per game, shooting 43% from the field and 39% from the three. Senior guard Mitch Ballock has less time played but has been lethal on the court this season for the Blue Jays, shooting an average of 46% from the field and 40% from the three-point line.

Creighton is one of the **sharpest offenses** in the Big East, but the Blue Jays can also play a pretty solid defense; the Blue Jays have allowed the lowest 2-point percentage and assist rate in the Big East.

Xavier Musketeers Outlook
-------------------------

The Musketeers are sitting just outside the bubble for the NCAA Tournament, and a win at home against Creighton would have **massive implications** for the team going into the tournament.

Xavier’s February had been hampered earlier this month was a **two-week layoff**, and the subsequent effect on the Musketeers shooting has been difficult. The Musketeers have had a team average of 38% from the field and 24% from the three in their last three games. Sophomore forward Zach Freemantle currently leads the team in scoring, averaging 16.9 points per game with 8.9 rebounds per game. Senior guard Paul Scruggs follows behind Freemantle in scoring for the Musketeers, averaging 13.9 points per game and shooting 44% from the field and 32% from the three.

Xavier, for all their recent **shooting woes**, has one of the highest assist rates in the NCAA, sitting at over 60% of all field goals coming from an assist. A strong rebounding effort against Creighton at home could turn the tide in the Musketeers' favor if they can get their shooting together.

Betting Line and Pick
---------------------

Xavier has continued to struggle since the early February two-week layoff and is 4-2 in their last six home games. The Musketeers, while being 5-5 in conference play, have **yet to record a win against a team with a winning record** in the Big East.

Going into Saturday’s game, Creighton is the superior team and are four-point favorites going into the game. The Over/Under is set at 146.5. Creighton has proven they can score and **expect them to win by more than seven against Xavier**.

**PICK: Creighton -6.5**
