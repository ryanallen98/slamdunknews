The New Orleans Pelicans host the Boston Celtics on Sunday afternoon for some matinee basketball. New Orleans is one of the best young teams in the NBA, while the Celtics are a young team looking to turn into a title contender.

Boston comes into this game with a record of 15-14, which puts them in third place in the Atlantic Division. The Celtics have struggled to find consistency this season, but they can be really good when putting it all together.

The New Orleans Pelicans have lost five of their last six games, and they bring a record of 12-17 into this game. New Orleans will have a chance to compete for a playoff spot this season, but they need to turn things around in a hurry.

The Celtics are 2.5-point road favorites over New Orleans on Sunday afternoon.

Boston Looking For Scoring
--------------------------

The Celtics have some terrific offensive pieces this season, but they have had to battle through a ton of injuries. Boston is averaging just 110.7 points per game, and that is not good enough for a team this talented.

Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown have combined for more than 51 points per game, and they will look to power the Celtics in this game. Kemba Walker has chipped in with 17 points per game, but Boston needs more from their veteran this season.

Boston remains a solid defensive team, allowing just 109.4 points per game. The Celtics will have to lock in on the defensive end of the floor as the Pelicans will be looking to play fast in this one.

Pelicans Playing Fast
---------------------

The New Orleans Pelicans play extremely fast, which has allowed them to average 114.6 points per game this season. New Orleans has also given up more than 115 points per game, and the young Pelicans roster needs to get better on that end of the floor.

Zion Willamson leads the team with 25 points per game, and Brandon Ingram has chipped in with 23.6 points per game. Both of these players are playing at an All-Star level, but they need some help to upset the Celtics.

New Orleans will have to stop Brown and Tatum if they are going to win this game, but that’s easier said than done. The Pelicans can’t simply hope to win this game by outscoring the Celtics.

Celtics Get it Done on the Road
-------------------------------

Things have not gone as well as expected for the Boston Celtics this season, but they are simply too talented to continue to struggle. Boston will take advantage of a bad defensive effort from the Pelicans in this game, and it should allow them to score some points.

New Orleans has some young talent that will be tough to beat in the coming years, but they aren’t ready to compete this season. The Pelicans will keep this game close, but they won’t be able to get enough stops to win the game.

Bet the Boston Celtics -2.5 over the New Orleans Pelicans in this NBA showdown.
