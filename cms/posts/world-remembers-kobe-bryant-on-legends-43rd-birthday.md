On Kobe Bryant's 43rd birthday, social media was flooded with tributes to him.

‍

The memories and affection for Kobe Bryant, the Lakers legend who died in a helicopter accident on Jan. 26, 2020, have not faded with the passage of time.

‍

Bryant's legend has grown after his death, thanks to his entrance into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame and the NBA's decision to name the All-Star MVP award after the five-time league champion.

‍

On what would have been Bryant's 43rd birthday on Monday, those who knew him personally, competed against him, or simply admired him from afar joined in a social media outpouring of well wishes.

‍

Many of the wishes also included his daughter, Gigi Bryant, who also passed away with him.
