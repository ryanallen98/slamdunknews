Two Top-15 Big 12 powerhouses will clash again on Tuesday night, with the Red Raiders being the 5 point home favorites. These two met last month in West Virginia, where the Mountaineers pulled out a buzzer-beater victory, 88-87, on a last-second shot by star guard Miles McBride, and Tech guard Mac McClung couldn't answer at the buzzer. West Virginia comes into this one hot off a great 12 point win against a Top-25 Kansas team, putting on the offensive guns to win 91-79. Texas Tech, on the other hand, just easily rolled a below-average Kansas State team 73-62, so both teams come into this **hotly contested match-up** on a fiery run, hoping to continue their runs right into the tournament in March.

West Virginia’s Star Offense
----------------------------

The Mountaineers have been riding their two stars Miles McBride and Derek Culver, who both average 15 points per game, to victory this season, and they desperately need these two to score because it is the Mountaineer offense that has been winning, not their defense. They are putting up 76.6 points per game on 43% shooting, which has been good enough for 13-5 this year. However, on the other end of the court, they are giving up 70 points per game, which has climbed into the 80s five times this year. So to win this game against a potent Texas Tech offense and defense, the Mountaineers **will have to perform** on both ends of the floor.

The Red Raiders’ Brick Wall
---------------------------

Defense. The defense has always been the key to Chris Beard’s winning Tech teams. And what is even better is that his players love that part of the game. They dart around and swarm opposing ball-handlers, wreaking havoc on star players and offenses. And it is all because of their heart and spirit. Texas Tech before Chris Beard had been an afterthought, a terrible team that was viewed as a walkover, so these Red Raiders are still **hungry to prove themselves**. They burst onto the Top-25 scene a few years ago with their defense and have kept up that zeal and energy to hold teams to a shocking 60 PPG this year. If they can repeat that Tuesday night, they should leave the court victorious.

Betting Prediction
------------------

If both teams hold true to their identities of this year, this one **should be all Red Raiders**. This is a revenge game after their heartbreaking 1 point loss, so Texas Tech will come in with an adapted game plan and a fire to crush the Mountaineers. But the key to this one is the stats of their last meeting. First off, Texas Tech led by ten going into the final stretch, but somehow fell apart and handed the Mountaineers a win. But more importantly, West Virginia shoots 43% from the field on average, but in the teams’ January clash, they somehow shot 58% and 63% from behind the arc. Against a 14th ranked Texas Tech defense that is just simply not going to happen again. The Red Raider defense will smother West Virginia, and Mac McClung and the offense will do enough to win comfortably. Give me Texas Tech and the 5 points.

**Texas Tech Red Raiders -5**.
