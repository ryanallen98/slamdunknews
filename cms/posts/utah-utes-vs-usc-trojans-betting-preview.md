The Pac-12 Tournament resumes with a quarterfinal matchup between the (7) Utah Utes (12-12, 8-11 Pac-12) and the (2) USC Trojans (21-6, 15-5 Pac-12) on Thursday evening. Tip-off from T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas is set for 8:30pm EST. This will be the **third meeting** of the year between the two schools, with the Trojans defending their home floor at the beginning of January and the Utes returning the favor in Utah when USC was ranked 19th in the country.

UTAH OUTLOOK
------------

The Utes advanced to the quarters by virtue of their win over Washington on Wednesday in the first round of the tournament. Utah got double-digit contributions from six different players, **building a 17-point lead** they had to hold on to, withstanding a late Husky rally with a 98-95 win. Washington may have fought valiantly in the comeback attempt but still concluded their season with their worst winning percentage since the 1993-94 campaign.

Utah closed out their regular season, **winning two of their last three**, including the 10-point victory over the Trojans on February 27. Prior to that win, however, the Utes had dropped four in a row, their second four-game skid of the season.

With a win on Thursday, Utah will have won two games in a Pac-12 Tournament for the first time since 2016. Last year they advanced to the NCAA Tournament Field of 68.

USC OUTLOOK
-----------

The Trojans secured the No. 2 seed in the conference tourney, receiving a bye into the quarterfinals with Oregon on the other side of the bracket as the top seed. USC won their final two games of the regular season to finish 21-6, the fifth time in the Andy Enfield era they have eclipsed the 20-win plateau.

USC’s **best stretch** of the season ironically began with a win over Utah, stretching from January 2-February 17 when they won 13 out of 14 with win-streaks of six and seven games, respectively. They climbed as high as 17th in the national rankings, ending the regular season as the No. 24th ranked team in the country.

BETTING LINE AND PICK
---------------------

USC is favored in this Pac-12 Tournament Quarterfinal by 7.5 with an over/under of 140. USC was 16-11 ATS this season and 7-3 in their last 10 games, while Utah was 10-14 and 5-5.

The Trojans won the first meeting by 18 as 5-point favorites, and then the Utes won the rematch outright by 10 as 4.5-point underdogs. **Both games went well UNDER** their posted totals, so keep that in mind if you’d rather wager on the total instead of either side.

USC is the higher seed and the more talented team, but they don’t have a single player on their roster who has played in the Pac-12 Tournament and just one that has any experience in the Big Dance. Utah, meanwhile, has scored 196 points over their last two games, and we’ll **gladly take the generous amount of points** in this one, though USC should ultimately move on to the semis.

**Pick: Utah +7.5**
