Plenty of action took place in the NBA Tuesday night, as we saw some great performances, dunks, and of course, upset wins. Here are a few of the top stories from Tuesday's NBA action.

Josh Hart’s Near 20-20 Game Propels the Pelicans
------------------------------------------------

When the Pelicans traded Anthony Davis to the Lakers, they acquired three players: Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram, and Josh Hart. The first two were expected to be top-tier guys, while Hart was supposed to be a role player. However, Hart has been excellent for the team since coming over, and his efforts on Tuesday night trump anything else he has done in the NBA to date.

Hart logged 40 minutes off the Pels bench, finishing with 20 points, 17 rebounds, three assists, and two blocked shots. New Orleans won by 29 as Houston was out of sorts all night. At one juncture, Hart had an and-one, missed the free throw, then got his own rebound and created another and-one. He was just unstoppable. Zion Williamson’s early foul trouble could not keep Hart from doing his thing from the minute the game began.

Weirdly, for Houston, John Wall shot the ball horribly. He was 11-23 from the floor, but just 2-8 from three and 1-6 from the free-throw line. It’s unusual for a player of his caliber to miss easy looks so often. But, shoutout to Josh Hart. If only for one night, Hart was the team MVP over Zion and Ingram.

Durant-less Nets Fall to Pistons
--------------------------------

The Nets have Kyrie Irving, Kevin Durant, and James Harden on their roster, though Durant is in COVID-19 protocol for a second time after the Friday night debacle. But even when all of these guys were playing together, the team cannot grind out consistent wins. When they traded away Caris LeVert, Jarrett Allen, and Taurean Prince, they also lost their defensive identity.

Without Durant, the Nets came up short in an unacceptable 122-111 loss to the 5-18 Pistons. Jerami Grant put up 32 points and four assists. Delon Wright had 22 points and nine assists. And Mason Plumlee feasted against the size-lacking Nets, finishing with 14 points, 12 rebounds, seven assists, two steals, and three blocks in an absolutely dominant effort.

Frankly, there should be no excuses for the Nets. Harden has been a winner on his own. Irving still hasn’t won on his own yet but is still capable of taking over a game. We know what Durant can do when he's in the lineup. When will Brooklyn figure it out? They are currently 14-12.

Jazz Become the First Team to 20 Wins
-------------------------------------

After knocking off the Celtics, the Utah Jazz have improved to 20-5 for the season. They have been a tough team to beat and have been winners in 16 of their last 17 games. The last time they had a record like this out of the gate was in the 1996-97 season.

Utah went to the finals that year. Donovan Mitchell had just been born in September of 1996, so it is somewhat poetic that he’s the one guiding them on this incredible run. You can’t help but feel for the Jazz after they blew the 3-1 lead in the first-round last year and lost to Denver. This start has been nothing short of remarkable.
