After defeating the Los Angeles Clippers in the Western Conference finals, the Phoenix Suns advanced to the NBA Finals for the first time since 1993.

‍

They won the series 4-2 by defeating the Clippers 130-103. The Suns were led by Chris Paul, who scored 41 points, and Devin Booker, who scored 22. In the best-of-seven championship final, they will face either the Milwaukee Bucks or the Atlanta Hawks.

‍

Paul, 36, has been named to 11 NBA All-Star teams and has two Olympic gold medals with the United States, but this is his first trip to the Finals since joining the Suns from Oklahoma City last year.

‍

Paul, who was a member of the Clippers from 2011 to 2017, added: "I'm just so happy for all the people around me. To do it here against a team I have the utmost respect for. I'll always be a Clipper. I love these fans."

‍

The Suns had squandered the chance to win the series at home on Monday, but they made no mistakes at the Staples Centre. The Suns had failed to even make the play-offs for ten consecutive seasons prior to the 2020-2021 season.

‍

They had a 17-point lead near the end of the third quarter before the Clippers, who had lost Kawhi Leonard and Serge Ibaka to injuries throughout the playoffs, scored 10 unanswered points.

‍

Paul, on the other hand, seized centre stage once more with eight points to increase the Suns' lead. His four-point play midway through the fourth quarter gave them a 111-92 advantage, and the Clippers had little chance of catching up. The Suns had tried everything they could to stop Clipper’s star Paul George, who scored 41 points in game five, and their displeasure was increased late in the game when Patrick Beverley was dismissed for slamming Paul to the ground.
