The **Milwaukee Bucks** and **Washington Wizards** will meet in DC for the second time in three nights on Monday evening. This will be the middle affair of three total meetings this season.

The **Bucks grabbed a 125-119 win over the Wizards** on Saturday night. **Giannis Antetokounmpo** notched his sixth triple-double of the season (and second in as many games) with 33 points (12/19 FG), 11 rebounds, and 11 assists. Seven other Bucks also scored in double figures.

**Russell Westbrook** (42 points, 16/32 FG) led the way for Washington without Bradley Beal, while Rui Hachimura added a season-high 29 points (one off his career-high).

Let’s take a look at the second game between these two sides to find **the best value play**.

Milwaukee Bucks
---------------

The **Bucks are now ten games over .500 for the first time this season**. A three-way race is shaping up for the East’s top seed with Milwaukee, Brooklyn, and Philadelphia.

The **trend of Milwaukee taking care of sub-.500 teams in the East remains strong**. They have only lost two such games this year and are 11-2 against the lesser teams in the East.

For the first time since February 2, someone other than **Antetokounmpo** led the team in rebounds. Donte DiVincenzo snatched a career-best 13 boards on Saturday night.

The **Bucks** did not shoot particularly well on Saturday, and that was why the game remained close. The team shot 43.4% from the field while committing 18 turnovers, one shy of a season-high. Outside of a ten-point lead the Wizards held for about three minutes in the first half, the game stayed within single digits the entire night.

Washington Wizards
------------------

The **Wizards managed to stay competitive even without Bradley Beal**, who was kept out of Saturday’s game due to left knee soreness. Davis Bertans also missed the game with a calf injury he picked up on Friday. Bertans is questionable to play Monday, but Beal is not listed on the injury report and should be good to go.

Despite their disappointing first half of the campaign, the **Wizards** still have a shot to work their way into the play-in playoff picture. They are third from the bottom in the East but sit just 2.5 games back of the tenth and final play-in spot.

**Westbrook’s 42 points were a season high**, and his first 40-point triple-double February 15, 2019. He now has six triple-doubles since February 16.

What to wager
-------------

It is a similar story as far as the odds are concerned on Monday. The **Bucks are 9.5-point favorites**. The “mini-series” results from this season for these teams tell the story.

This is the **Wizards’ fourth time playing a team back-to-back** in either two or three nights and the first against a team who is over .500 at the time of playing. The team is 0-3 in the second leg of those back-to-backs.

**Milwaukee** has done this dance four times as well. They are 5-3 in mini-series games in total, sweeping both the Pistons and the Cavaliers earlier this season. A ten-point victory for Milwaukee is certainly in the cards, so I will lay off the spread and point total of 239.

Instead, I’m looking at **DiVincenzo**, who has been a production machine as of late. His counting stats have exceeded his projected totals in just about every game for the last two weeks. You can bank him at over 19.5 points, rebounds, and assists OR simply over 5.5 rebounds (which he has done in five of the last six games).

**The Pick**: Donte DiVincenzo over 19.5 points, rebounds, and assists (-103)
