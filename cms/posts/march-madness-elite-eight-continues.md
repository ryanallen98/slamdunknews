##### The 2021 NCAA Tournament is set to resume tonight: Houston and Baylor won their NCAA tournament regional final games last night and have already reached the Final Four. Two more teams will join them tonight.

##### After tonight's two final Elite Eight matches, 2021 Final Four of the 2021 NCAA men's tournament will officially be set.

**Game Schedule:** 

The Elite Eight continues when USC takes on Gonzaga and then Michigan meets UCLA in the East Region final, with tipoff scheduled for 9:57 p.m. ET.

Both games will be aired on TBS.

7:15 p.m.: (1) Gonzaga vs. (6) USC, TBS, Lucas Oil Stadium

9:57 p.m.: (1) Michigan vs. (11) UCLA, TBS, Lucas Oil Stadium

**Picks - USC/GONZAGA OVER 153**

The over has been incredibly beneficial in Gonzaga games, cashing in 39 of the Bulldogs' last 56 games overall. The over is also 38-17 in their previous 55 games when favoured, is 36-17 in their previous 53 games coming off a win, and is 12-4 in their last 16 games as a favourite.

The over is 5-1-1 for the Trojans' with the last seven games following an ATS win, is 3-0-1 in their previous four games were also a following success, and is 3-1-1 in their last five games overall. The over is also 3-1-1 in USC's last five neutral site games.

‍

The Final Four is at stake when the No. 1 seed Michigan Wolverines take on the11th-seeded UCLA. While UCLA (21-9) has a storied tradition that no school can match with 11 national titles, the Wolverines (23-4) are making their fourth Elite Eight appearance since 2013 and own the most NCAA Tournament wins (21) of any team during that time. 

Michigan is coming off a unexpectedly easy 76-58 victory over fourth-seeded Florida State while the Bruins needed overtime to dispatch No. 2 Alabama in the Sweet 16.
