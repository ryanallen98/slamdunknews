It’s a **Big 10 matchup** as the No. 9 Iowa Hawkeyes (17-6, 11-5) take on the No. 3 University of Michigan Wolverines (16-1, 11-1) at the Crisler Center in Ann Arbor, Michigan on Thursday night. Tip-off is set for 7:00 PM EST.

This will be the **first meeting** of these two sides this year, with their last game occurring on January 20th, 2020, with the Hawkeyes winning 90-83 at home.

Iowa Hawkeyes Outlook
---------------------

The Hawkeyes have **rebounded from their struggles** earlier this season when they were missing Sophomore guard CJ Frederick with a lower leg injury. Frederick made his return against Rutgers, where the Hawkeyes won 79-66. While Frederick didn’t score and ended with 3 assists and 2 rebounds in that game, his presence made the whole team look more comfortable.

Standing at 6’11”, senior center Luka Garza has **been a powerhouse** for the Hawkeyes this season, averaging 24.5 points per game and shooting 56% from the field. In his last two games against Penn State and Wisconsin, Garza averaged 26.5 points and 9.5 rebounds.

The Hawkeyes have **proven they can compete** with the best of the best, and if their high-powered offense can come alive, they are sure to be a threat to the Wolverines’ wish to secure the title at home.

Michigan Wolverines Outlook
---------------------------

The Wolverines will be coming into the game after securing a 92-87 victory over the Ohio State Buckeyes. Michigan should be feeling their absolute best following the victory at Ohio State and will be **looking to cement their position** as the No. 1 seed. The Wolverines have only dropped one game this season, with a loss at Minnesota back in January. Since that game, the Wolverines have been dominant in the Big 10.

Michigan’s freshman center, Hunter Dickinson, is taller than nearly everyone he faces on the court. Standing in at an impressive 7’1”, Dickinson is **dominant in the paint**. In his rookie year, he has averaged a team-high of 15 points per game and 7.8 rebounds per game.

Senior forward Isaiah Livers **follows Dickinson in scoring**, averaging 14.4 points per game and shooting 47% from the field and 32% from the three.

If Michigan can get the win at home here, they're all but **certain to be the No. 1 seed** from the Big 10 before the tournament starts in just a few weeks.

Betting Line and Pick
---------------------

The Wolverines are having a truly dominant season this year and come into this matchup as **four-point-favorites** with the Over/Under set at 156.

While the Hawkeyes have shown they can play with the best of the best, the Wolverines from Michigan truly is the **best of the best** this year. Having only lost one game over a month ago and taking the win from the Buckeyes earlier this week, Michigan will be coming into the game feeling confident and loose.

The Hawkeyes will need to bring every piece of offense in order to secure the upset win in Ann Arbor Wednesday night. If you are taking the safe pick here, **Michigan is the way** to go, as their shooting and just sheer size are sure to stifle the Hawkeyes on both ends of the court.

**Pick: Michigan -4, OVER 156.**
