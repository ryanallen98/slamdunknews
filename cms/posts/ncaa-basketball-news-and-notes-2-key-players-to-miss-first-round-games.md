Michigan and Villanova, two title contenders, lost key contributors over the last couple of weeks right before or during conference tournaments. Collin Gillespie tore his MCL and **will miss the remainder of the season** while Isaiah Livers is battling a foot injury with no timetable for his return. Gillespie was a co-Big East Player of the Year, and Livers was the Wolverines' second-leading scorer.

Iowa **lost their top player off the bench** when Jack Nunge hurt his knee at the beginning of March, forcing him out the rest of the way, and Florida has been without Keyontae Johnson, who suffered a heart issue in December.

Kansas, Duke, and Virginia were all forced out of their conference tournaments due to positive COVID-19 tests. The Jayhawks and Cavaliers still earned bids into the Big Dance while the Blue Devils lost out on an NCAA Tournament opportunity. Kansas **remains arguably the most affected**, with three players enrolled in the COVID-19 protocol.

This is already shaping up to be an **unpredictable tournament**, even before any games tip-off, as we continue to receive news and updates with various teams' and their situations. Let's take a look at two additional key absences that could have a big impact this weekend.

HARMON OUT FOR SOONERS
----------------------

Oklahoma sophomore guard De'Vion Harmon will miss Saturday's game against Missouri in the NCAA Tournament after testing positive for COVID-19, Sooners coach Lon Kruger announced Wednesday afternoon.

Kruger told the media that **no other members of the team have tested positive** or been involved in contract tracing. He said the origin of Harmon's case is unknown and that staff is unsure if it is connected to Oklahoma's Big 12 Tournament game versus Kansas, which ultimately withdrew the Jayhawks from the tournament after COVID-19 issues.

Harmon, who would be unavailable in OU's second game, is the Sooners' second-leading scorer. He averaged 12.9 points, 3.4 rebounds, and two assists this season. The winner of Oklahoma and Missouri will face the winner of the First Round matchup between Gonzaga and the First Four game featuring Appalachian State and Norfolk State.

GEORGIA TECH TO BE WITHOUT STAR WRIGHT
--------------------------------------

Georgia Tech's Moses Wright, the ACC player of the year, will **miss the team's first-round game due to COVID-19** as well.

Tuesday, coach Josh Pastner announced a member of the team's travel party had tested positive but did not reveal the particular individual's identity. Wright, a 6-9, 233-pound forward, averages 17.4 points, shooting 53.2% overall and 41.4% on 3s, 8.0 rebounds, 1.6 blocks, and 1.5 steals for the Yellow Jackets.

The Yellow Jackets are scheduled to face Loyola-Chicago on Friday afternoon in the First Round, with the winner moving on to face either Illinois or Drexel. Even if Georgia Tech knocks out the Ramblers, Wright would again be unavailable for the Round of 32 matchups.

The ACC Tournament Champions enter the NCAA Tournament winners of eight straight games, three of which came against teams ranked in the Top 20. GT has not tasted defeat since February 12 against Clemson.
