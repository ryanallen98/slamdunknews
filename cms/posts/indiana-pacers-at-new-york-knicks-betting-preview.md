A pair of old **Eastern Conference** foes meet at Madison Square Garden on Saturday night when the Indiana Pacers visit the New York Knicks. Both teams are in the thick of the playoff picture as the All-Star Break approaches.

This is the third meeting between the two sides this season, but the first since January 3rd. The teams split their first two games, both of which were played in **Indianapolis**.

Let’s dive into this matchup to find the best play for your **Saturday** night.

Indiana Pacers
--------------

Due to a pair of postponed games against Texas teams last week, Indiana had to go a full week without playing a game. They have been thrown right back into the fire with three games in four days against playoff teams.

Saturday night’s matchup will be the second half of a back-to-back after the team lost their second game in a row on Friday night. With the postponed games, they now have just one win in the last two weeks, an overtime victory against Minnesota. Indiana is surprisingly 4-1 this season after playing the night before.

The team remains extremely average while they wait for **Caris LeVert** and **TJ Warren** to return from long stints on the shelf. Entering Saturday, Indiana is 15th out of 30 in points per game and 15th in opponent points allowed per game.

New York Knicks
---------------

The resurgence of the **Knicks** may come as a surprise to some, but those who have seen Tom Thibodeau do this elsewhere see this as less of a shock. The man took the Timberwolves to the playoffs after a 14-season drought. **THE TIMBERWOLVES**.

The Knicks haven’t tasted the playoffs since 2013, but a jumbled-up conference and two extra play-in spots have opened the door for New York.

The team goes as **Julius Randle** goes. He has turned out to be an excellent signing in New York, averaging 23 points and 11 rebounds this year. Randle’s production has taken an extra step without Mitchell Robinson, whom the Knicks will be without for about another month.

Since being acquired via trade, Derrick Rose has found his footing as a veteran mentor. Rose has scored 14+ points in five of the six games in which he has played at least 20 minutes.

It is hard to tell where the bench production will come from on any given night, but there are several players capable of going off at a moment’s notice. In the Knicks’ 140-point outburst against **Sacramento** on Thursday, Alec Burks and Immanuel Quickley combined to score 49 points in just 45 minutes on the floor.

What to wager
-------------

When these two teams met on opening night, the game was played inside a five-point margin for almost all of the first three quarters, and then the Pacers pulled away for a double-digit win. Their second meeting was more of the same, and a 25-point night from **RJ Barrett** helped seal the win for the **Knicks**.

New York continues to bring the league scoring averages down to earth as the NBA’s best defense and second-worst offense. That’s a **Tom Thibodeau** team for you. They proved they can play fast after Thursday night’s game that featured 261 points, but that is the exception rather than the rule against the Kings’ league-worst defense.

With the **Pacers** scuffling, this feels like a prime opportunity for the **Knicks** to continue their winning ways. We should ALL be careful with the previous sentence, but the team are winners of five of their last seven games. **I’ll take New York in a tight one**.

The Pick: Knicks +1 (-112)
