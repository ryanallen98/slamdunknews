The Los Angeles Lakers lost 11 consecutive games to the Toronto Raptors, dating back to November of 2014.

But their losing streak is over; maybe all they needed was a change of scenery as they were on fire last night. The whole squad turned up in Tampa Bay, Florida's Amalie Arena, and finally defeated Toronto 110-101.

The Lakers ended up tipping things off with 45% of their triples from the start of the game, compared to 15% from the Raptors.

Ultimately, they are still waiting for title-contending days ahead when LeBron James and Anthony Davis return.

It was clear that both teams were nowhere near full strength for the game. But for the Lakers (32-19), the 110-101 victory was more meaningful as they knew they had to win this final battle.

Coach Frank Vogel stated:

"We we re all on a long flight, angry about how that game went," he said." And our mindset was to take it out on the Raptors, and we did."

Toronto(20-31) came in with their head held high due to their win against Washington the previous night, but this didn't last long as the Lakers wedged their best advantage from the bench, where Horton-Tucker took the lead.

A minor scuffle occurred in the first quarter of the game where O.G. Anuno by threw Dennis Schroder to the floor with what the Lakers guard called a" WWE-style" move.

But that didn't stop them, and the second-year guard added six assists as the Laker reserves outscored their Toronto counterparts 49-30. As a whole, the team racked up 29 assists on 39 baskets – by far their highest total assist figure in the ten games.
