Mitchell is a likely lottery pick after his ongoing performance over the season.

‍

The star of the Bears NCAA Tournament title run and reigning Big 12 Defensive Player of the year finally announced that he would be entering the 2021 NBA draft on Tuesday. Baylor guard Davion Mitchell will hire an agent and declare for the 2021 NBA draft, forgoing his remaining collegiate eligibility.

‍

Mitchell, who led the Bears to their national championship, was named the Naismith Defensive Player of the Year after averaging 14.1 points, 5.5 assists, 2.7 rebounds, and 1.9 steals 30 games.

‍

He previously played for the Baylor Bears and the Auburn Tigers, and he was also named the Big 12 Defensive Player of the Year, the first in school history to win.

‍

Mitchell said in a statement on his Instagram account announcing his decision:

‍

"Playing in the NBA has always been a dream of mine, and I truly believe I am ready to start living that dream,"

‍

The 2021 NBA Draft is scheduled to take place on 29 July 2021.
