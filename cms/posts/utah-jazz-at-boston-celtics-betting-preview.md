The **Boston Celtics** host the NBA’s best on Tuesday night when the **Utah Jazz** travel east. This is the second and final meeting between these two sides, with the Jazz capturing a 122-108 victory on February 10.

This is the first of four games on the road against **Eastern Conference** teams for Utah, who hold a two-game lead over Phoenix for the top seed in the West. The Celtics are towards the front of the second tier of teams in the East at 20-18. They currently sit in the #5 position and look down at six teams within three-and-a-half games.

Let’s dive into this **inter-conference battle** to see where we can pick out **the best value bet**.

Utah Jazz
---------

The **Jazz are the best team in the league because of their seemingly incomprehensible run of 20 wins in 21 games spread across January and February**. They have come back to earth slightly with four losses in six games for the first time this season. Rudy Gobert snatched a career-high 28 rebounds in their loss to Golden State on Sunday.

There is one glaring statistic you can turn to when breaking down Jazz games this year, field goal percentage. **Utah has won the FG% battle in 25 games this season**. They have won ALL of those games (25-0). When their opponent outshoots them, they are a brutal 3-10.

In addition to their stellar FG% output, the **Jazz are the only team in the league who can boast a top-5 scoring offense and a top-5 scoring defense**. At 116.6 points per game, only the Nets and Bucks put the ball in the cup more often. Defensively, the team’s 108.2 points allowed per game is fifth-best behind the Knicks, Lakers, Heat, and Suns.

Boston Celtics
--------------

**Boston** enters this game, **winners of five of their last six games**. Four of those five wins have come against struggling teams, with a victory over the Clippers mixed in as well.

The trio of **Jayson Tatum**, **Jaylen Brown**, and **Kemba Walker** have been operating like a well-oiled machine as of late. The three of them have averaged 59.5 combined points over the last four games.

The team also just got **Marcus Smart** back from a calf injury. After missing 18 games, the seven-year veteran has averaged 20 minutes in the two games since his return after the All-Star Break. Expect Smart to give Boston a boost defensively as he returns to his standard allotment of minutes for a team that is already top ten in opponent points per game.

What to wager
-------------

**The Jazz come to Boston as 4.5-point favorites with the total set at 228.5**. This number is right on the nose despite the Celtics’ recent good run of form. They have only faced six teams with records over .500 since the beginning of February.

The NBA in 2021 doesn’t leave a lot of wiggle room with a total of 228.5. Both teams have been sporadic with their totals over the last few weeks. These two finished at 230 back on February 10, but with Marcus Smart back in the picture, I **expect the total to stay under**, with defense being the emphasis for the Celtics.

**The Pick**: Under 228.5 (-110)
