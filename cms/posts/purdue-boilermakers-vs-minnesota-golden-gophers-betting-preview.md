A pair of middle-of-the-pack Big Ten teams will try to add to their NCAA Tournament resume on Thursday night as the no. 24 Purdue Boilermakers visit the Minnesota Golden Gophers. At home, the **Golden Gophers are 2-point favorites** with the over/under for the game set at 138.5 points.

At the moment, Purdue looks to be **solidly** in the NCAA Tournament. However, two losses in their last four games have taken the Boilermakers out of the running for the Big Ten regular-season title. They currently sit at 13-7 and 8-5 in conference play with just six scheduled games left before the Big Ten Tournament.

As for the Golden Gophers, most projections have them in the Big Dance right now. But Minnesota should still be **considered on the bubble** at 12-7, especially since the Gophers are just 5-7 in conference play. A win over Nebraska on Monday helped Minnesota snap a three-game losing skid. But the Golden Gophers have still lost four of their last six games and need to create some momentum heading down the stretch.

Drive My Carr
-------------

Junior point guard Marcus Carr has **carried Minnesota this season**. The Pitt transfer is averaging 19.9 points and 5.4 assists per game, playing the role of both scorer and playmaker. Of course, when he struggles, the Gophers struggle. That was the case when Minnesota played Purdue last month and lost by 19 points, with Carr managing just six points.

Needless to say, the Golden Gophers **need more** out of their supporting cast if they’re going to keep their spot in the Big Dance. Center Liam Robbins is the team’s second-leading scorer at 13.2 points per game. The Drake transfer also chips in 7.2 rebounds and 2.7 blocks per game. However, he has struggled with foul trouble, playing just 14 minutes against Nebraska on Monday and fouling out of three of his last four games. Meanwhile, Minnesota shoots under 30% from the perimeter as a team, which shows how much they need Carr to carry them.

A Little Size
-------------

While Minnesota is a perimeter-oriented team, the Boilermakers tend to do their **damage** inside. Forward Trevion Williams is the team’s leading scorer with 15.4 points per game despite a subpar outing over the weekend against Northwestern. The 6’10’’ Williams is also a monster on the boards, averaging 9.6 rebounds per game and recording three double-doubles in his last four games. Meanwhile, 7’4’’ freshman Zach Edey is a wildcard who is not yet a consistent force but is coming off a double-double against Northwestern on Saturday.

The Purdue backcourt is also solid. Sasha Stefanovic and Brandon Newman both shoot over 40% from the three-point line, allowing them to punish teams that double-team Williams in the post. Also, junior Eric Hunter is one of the most underrated point guards in the Big Ten. Most importantly, he’s **arguably the best defensive player** in the Big Ten and was a big reason why Carr only scored six points when these teams played last month.

Gopher Stew
-----------

Despite Minnesota being favored in this game, Purdue has a great volume of scorers and a more versatile offense. Unless Carr can have a huge game against one of the Big Ten’s best defensive players in Hunter, the Golden Gophers will have a difficult time turning things around after losing 81-62 to the Boilermakers last month. **Bet on Purdue to win** on the road.
