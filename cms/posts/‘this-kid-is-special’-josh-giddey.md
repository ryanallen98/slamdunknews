Josh Giddey, an Australian player, has dominated the NBA in his first two weeks.

 

The rookie's previous five games have been very outstanding, with him averaging 13.8 points, 5.6 rebounds, 6.8 assists, and 1.8 steals while looking considerably more at ease at the highest level. And it's not just the Australians who are pleased about the Oklahoma City Thunder's sixth-round pick.

 

Giddey, who came in at No. 6 and was a bit of a surprise pick, is also making waves in the United States.

 

John Hollinger of The Athletic lauded the adolescent for his advanced playmaking skills, lane floater, and ability to stay low while dribbling despite his upright posture.

 

“In particular, his craft on the ball stands out. Despite theoretically being a secondary ballhandler as a wing, Giddey has already mastered looking off help defenders and zipping passes to unexpected places, especially with the ball in his left hand (Giddey is right-handed but doesn’t always play like it),” Hollinger wrote.

 

“He also has a nice right-hand floater that he can use when defences overplay the pass, and at 6-8, he can get his shots away in the basket area.”

 

Giddey is sixth among rookies in points per game (11.3), third in rebounds (5.7), first in assists (5.9), and tied for second in steals (1.4) and blocks (1.4) through seven games (0.7).

 

The young gun is coming off one of his most remarkable performances ever, with 15 points, one triple, five rebounds, seven assists, two steals, and two blocks in the Thunder's tight 99-94 loss to the LA Clippers on Tuesday.

 

The fact that Giddey wasn't scared to step up and make plays in the fourth quarter when the game was on the line, twice taking it straight to Clippers superstar Paul George and scoring on him, was perhaps the most amazing aspect of it.

 

“You can make the Paul George jokes all you want to, but we can all agree dude is a superstar player. And an 18-year old hit a spot up shot over him and took him to the rack in the clutch moments of this game,” Stiles said.

 

“This meant a ton to the Clippers. And yet for the majority of the stretch of the last five minutes in this game, Josh Giddey controlled the game and dominated the game against an MVP, Defensive Player of the Year calibre player.”

 

Last year, Giddey became the youngest Australian to record a triple-double in the NBL, with a total of four.

 

And, after making the jump to the NBA, where games are lengthier, Cody Taylor of Rookie Wire predicted Giddey will have at least five triple-doubles this season.

 

In the preseason, the youngster had a double-double and flirted with a triple-double, putting up 13 points, nine rebounds, and eight assists.

 

But it just seems a matter of time before Giddey delivers that big phrase that commands even more attention than he's already gotten, and that he rightfully deserves.
