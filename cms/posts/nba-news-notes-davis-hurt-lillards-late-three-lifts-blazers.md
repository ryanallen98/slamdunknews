It was another newsworthy day in the NBA on Sunday, featuring upsets, clutch performances, a potentially major injury, and surprise triple-doubles. Here are your quick highlights.

AD Leaves Lakers Loss with Injury
---------------------------------

Anthony Davis re-aggravated an Achilles injury Sunday during an awkward collision with Denver's Nikola Jokic. He missed two games last week with the injury.

Davis is expected to have an MRI on Monday to determine the seriousness of the injury. The Lakers are calling it a right Achilles strain.

Los Angeles needs AD in the lineup as much as possible. He ranks second on the team in points per game (22.5) and leads the team in rebounds per game (8.4) and blocks per game (1.8).

Dame Delivers in the Clutch
---------------------------

Locked in a tight duel with the Mavericks, Damian Lillard did what he does best: take over the game with clutch shooting. Tied in the final minute of the fourth quarter, Lillard hit a step back jumper from 29 feet and buried the long shot to give the Trail Blazers the lead, and eventually, the 121-118 win.

Even as Portland has been dealing with several injuries, they are finding ways to win games. Lillard finished the day with 34 points and 11 assists, as he continues to light the NBA on fire. No other player on the team scored more than 17, but he had just enough support. Luka Doncic finished with 44-7-9 in the defeat, pouring in yet another statistically dominant performance.

Dallas has lost so many of these tight games on the year and still has many questions to answer about Doncic's future. For now, this is just a painful loss to move past.

Wizards Stun Celtics
--------------------

Raise your hand if you had the Wizards beating Boston on Sunday. Your hand is probably down right now. Jayson Tatum shot 3-14, the Celtics bench was practically nonexistent, and the team trailed practically wire-to-wire against Washington. Sunday's 104-91 loss is not a game Boston will remember fondly.

But for the Wizards, this is what you want to see. Bradley Beal dominated once again, pouring in 35 points, while Russell Westbrook was a rebound short of another triple-double. They inserted Moe Wagner into the starting lineup, and though he had just 11 points, four rebounds, two steals, and a block, he brought tremendous energy. He was a +11 in his minutes.

There is a lot of potential on the Wizards roster. They just need to figure things out. Perhaps, this can be the start of that.

Plumlee’s First Triple-Double Lifts Pistons
-------------------------------------------

It isn’t a surprise to see Mason Plumlee have a good performance. In situations where he’s been a starter, he has proven to be a terrific playmaker. But to see a 17-10-10 night from him is a whole new level of impressive. Last night marked the first time in his long NBA career that Mason posted a triple-double. And it lifted the Pistons to a 123-112 victory.

Saddiq Bey has started to finally figure it out, finishing with 16-4-6 and three steals, a game after scoring 30 for the first time. Josh Jackson added 21 points off the bench. And they have been getting some decent performances in limited minutes from Dennis Smith Jr.

This was a bad loss for the Pelicans. But maybe, the Pistons are slowly starting to figure it out.
