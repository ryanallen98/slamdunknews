The Harlem Globetrotters basketball club has submitted a petition to NBA commissioner Adam Silver, wanting to be considered as an expansion franchise candidate.

‍

The Globetrotters asked the NBA to acknowledge the team's efforts in helping to spread basketball around the world by welcoming it into the league in a letter delivered to Silver on Monday.

‍

“As an organization whose storied history is already tightly interwoven within that of the NBA, the Harlem Globetrotters are looking for a long overdue seat at the table,” Globetrotters general manager Jeff Muun said in a statement.

‍

The Harlem Globetrotters have posted an official statement online which can be seen at their twitter page. (@Globies)

‍

“With the league already considering an expansion, the time has come. The Harlem Globetrotters stand ready to negotiate for a franchise.”

‍

Silver fuelled suspicion that the NBA was considering adding a 31st franchise by telling ESPN in a December interview that expansion was "inevitable." Seattle has long been regarded as the favourite to land a new NBA franchise. The city has been without a team since the SuperSonics relocated to Oklahoma City in 2008 and would theoretically have a better case than the Globetrotters because New York already has two NBA teams.

‍

The Globetrotters are a travelling exhibition team that has played thousands of games in 122 countries around the world since their inception in 1926. However, the club was instrumental in several pivotal moments in NBA history, most notably when Nathaniel Clifton, a Globetrotter, became the league's first Black player in 1950.

‍

Chuck Cooper of the Globetrotters became the first Black player to be drafted the same year, when the Boston Celtics selected him with the 14th overall choice.
