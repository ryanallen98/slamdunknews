  For this article, we’ll focus on the Big Ten, which had three teams in the Top
  5 last week, whereas the Big 12 had two teams in the Top 10, led by Baylor at
  No. 2. Sunday featured four games in the Big Ten, so let’s take a look at the
  three that had significant impacts on the national rankings.

The Big Ten and Big 12 have set themselves apart as the top conferences in college basketball this season, occupying 11 of the Top 25 spots in the national rankings as of Sunday. That number likely won’t change when the new rankings are released Monday, only some of the positions based on last week’s results. The only argument that can be made is which is the best conference in the country.

For this article, we’ll focus on the Big Ten, which had three teams in the Top 5 last week, whereas the Big 12 had two teams in the Top 10, led by Baylor at No. 2. Sunday featured four games in the Big Ten, so let’s take a look at the three that had significant impacts on the national rankings.

Michigan Outduels Ohio State
----------------------------

The spotlight was certainly on the conference here in the matchup of the weekend, pitting the third- and fourth-ranked teams in the nation against each other on Sunday afternoon. The Wolverines continue to impress despite a near-month-long layoff due to a COVID-19 outbreak, winning three straight after returning to play on Valentine’s Day.

Michigan withstood a combined 53 points from Buckeye stars E.J. Liddell and Duane Washington Jr., and had five of their own reach double figures in a shootout in Columbus. The Wolverines were led by Hunter Dickinson’s 22 points and nine rebounds, en route to the 92-87 win, improving their record to 16-1. Up next is another big test in the form of the Iowa Hawkeyes on Thursday in Ann Arbor.

Iowa Fends Off Nittany Lions
----------------------------

Speaking of the Hawkeyes, Iowa erased a five-point halftime deficit to beat Penn State Sunday night inside Carver-Hawkeye Arena, 74-68. Luka Garza led all scorers with 23 points, and in the process, he became the school’s all-time leading scorer. Garza passed Roy Marble, who played from 1985-89.

Iowa remains two games behind Michigan for the top spot in the Big Ten. The two teams were initially set to face off on March 4, but the game was moved up when the conference reshuffled the schedules last week. The Hawkeyes have now won four in a row after a skid that saw them drop four out of five. Following Michigan, they’ll face Ohio State, Nebraska, and Wisconsin to close out their regular-season slate.

Badgers Tame Wildcats
---------------------

No. 21 Wisconsin righted the ship Sunday during a 68-51 win over Northwestern at Welsh-Ryan Arena in Evanston, Illinois. They’ve now reached double-digit wins in the conference for the 18th time in 20 years, the only Big Ten team to accomplish that feat.

Micah Potter scored 19 points to lead five players in double figures, the first time the Badgers (16-8, 10-7 Big Ten) have done that since a win over UW-Green Bay on December 1. Senior point guard D’Mitrik Trice added 13, freshman guard Jonathan Davis and senior guard Brad Davison had 12 apiece, and sophomore Tyler Wahl produced all 10 of his points after halftime.

A big test awaits UW on Saturday in the form of Illinois. It will be three weeks to the day that the Fighting Illini trounced the Badgers by 15 in Madison, when Kofi Cockburn and Ayo Dosunmu combined for 44 points and 26 rebounds in the win.
