We’ve got a Big Ten battle in Minneapolis as the Illinois Fighting Illini (15-5, 11-3 Big Ten) take on the Minnesota Golden Gophers (13-9, 6-9 Big Ten) inside Williams Arena on Saturday afternoon. Tip-off is set for 3:30 pm EST. This is the **second of two regular-season meetings** between the two programs, with Illinois winning easily the first time around on their home floor, 92-65, back on December 16 in the conference opener for both schools.

ILLINOIS OUTLOOK
----------------

The Fighting Illini have reeled off **six straight wins** dating back to January 19, climbing all the way to No. 5 in the national rankings. They’ll close out their regular-season slate with arguably the toughest schedule in the country, going on the road to face Wisconsin, Michigan, and Ohio State. All three of those foes are currently ranked, with Illinois staring up at the Buckeyes and Wolverines inside the top five.

As a matter of fact, of their six remaining games (including Saturday’s matchup with Minnesota), only one will be played on their home floor. Brad Underwood’s bunch are **5-2 on the road** this year, however, and have not dropped one away from State Farm Arena since December 20 at Rutgers.

Most recently, Illinois held on to fend off Northwestern on Tuesday, winning by seven despite jumping out to a 25-7 lead. Kofi Cockburn **led the way** with 17 points and 10 rebounds, collecting his 14th double-double of the season.

MINNESOTA OUTLOOK
-----------------

The Gophers have dropped two straight, losing to Indiana on Wednesday and falling to Maryland on Valentine’s Day, both on the road. Minnesota is the only team in the Big Ten without a win away from their home floor (0-8), but they return to Williams Arena Saturday, where they are **13-1**, the most home wins in the conference.

Minny continues to struggle in Bloomington, falling again to the Hoosiers at Assembly Hall, where they’ve not won since 2012. They now find themselves sitting in 10th place in the Big Ten with five games remaining, though Illinois is easily **their toughest opponent** during this final stretch.

The Gophers’ third-leading scorer, Gabe Kalscheur, **injured his hand** during Tuesday’s practice, missed the Indiana game, and remains out indefinitely. Kalscheur is just 84 points shy of 1,000 in his career with Minnesota.

BETTING LINE AND PICK
---------------------

Illinois is **favored by 4.5** in this Big Ten battle, with an over/under of 147.5. As noted, the Illini won the first meeting by 27, closing as 9-point chalk. Cockburn dominated that day, posting 33 points and grabbing 13 rebounds in just 25 minutes. He became the first player since Michael Beasley in 2008 to put up those stats in 25 or fewer minutes against a Division I opponent.

These two may be headed in opposite directions, but our play leans the other way. Minnesota is a **completely different team** inside the Old Barn, beating formidable teams like Michigan, Ohio State, and Iowa, and convincingly no less. Meanwhile, four of the Illini’s wins during this current streak have come down to the wire, with two going into overtime. The home team has covered five straight in this series, and Minnesota is 8-1 ATS in their last 9 at Williams Arena. An outright upset isn’t out of the question here, but **we’ll gladly take the points**.

**Pick: Minnesota +4.5**
