The Bulls, Warriors, and Jazz are the only teams still undefeated. Through the first week of the season, Monday nights were not kind to the NBA's greatest teams. We had seven undefeated teams left before the games started. We had three players after the games were over. On Monday, the Denver Nuggets, Minnesota Timberwolves, Charlotte Hornets, and Washington Wizards all lost, leaving only three teams undefeated.

 

 

The Utah Jazz have arrived in a rather predictable manner. They played at the level of a 65-win team last season, according to their net rating, and they've only played twice this season. The Golden State Warriors have a legitimate MVP candidate in Stephen Curry, so their dominance in the standings isn't shocking. The Chicago Bulls, meanwhile, are offseason darlings who have so far backed up their preseason confidence with four wins in four tries.

 

We're dealing with small samples with the Chicago Bulls, but it's worth noting that Chicago has played twice as many games as Utah. The difference between 80 and 82 games is insignificant, but the difference between four and two is significant. We have twice as much evidence in support of Chicago as we do Utah if you overlook previous seasons. 

 

And in those four games, Chicago has provided answers to some of the season's most pressing issues. Despite the anxiety surrounding their defence, the Bulls are currently ranked sixth on that end of the floor. Although we're dealing with small samples, no defence has allowed less than 97.7 points per 100 possessions in a full season since the 2003-04 season. Their depth hasn't been as outstanding, although it's worth noting that Alize Johnson is the only reserve with a negative net rating who has played significant minutes. Their starters are annihilating opponents while their reserve isn't being annihilated.

 

This doesn't ensure anything in the long run, and there will almost certainly be regression in some areas. However, the team's most key players have mainly played well together thus far. For the time being, the main notion looks to be sound.

 

Last season, the Jazz were by far the finest regular-season club in the NBA. Through two games, they've only trailed the Miami Heat in net rating, and their shot profile has been as analytically sound as ever. They make the third-most 3-pointers in the NBA (44.5) while allowing opponents to shoot 35.5 percent of the time. In comparison to a game-long sample, this is a major advantage. Taking nine more 3-pointers per game than the opposition provides a significant cushion for poor shooting nights.

 

They've needed that buffer so far since their offence has struggled to get going. They're now relying on Rudy Gobert's outstanding defence, and that won't change until further notice.

 

Golden State has to be the favoured here from a schedule standpoint. They've already completed the most difficult portion of their preseason schedule, a three-game road trip through California in which they beat the Lakers, Clippers, and Kings. They have an away game against Oklahoma City on Tuesday before returning home for eight games in a row. They play the Grizzlies, Thunder, Hornets, Pelicans, Rockets, Hawks, Timberwolves, and Bulls during that time, and none of their opponents are particularly intimidating. There's enough area for a serious sprint here.

 

On the offensive end, the Warriors are fairly reliant on Stephen Curry, but recall that they beat the Lakers with him shooting 5-of-21 from the field, and their bench is outscoring opponents by roughly 10 points per 100 possessions when Curry isn't playing.
