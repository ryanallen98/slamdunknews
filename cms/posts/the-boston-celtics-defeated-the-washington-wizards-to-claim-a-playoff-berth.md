Jayson Tatum scored a game-high 50 points as the Boston Celtics beat the Washington Wizards 118-100 to secure their place in the NBA play-offs.

On Tuesday, Boston won the Eastern Conference play-in game, securing the seventh spot in the playoffs.

When the Washington Wizards meet the Indiana Pacers on Thursday, they will have one more shot to make the playoffs. The winner will earn the Eastern Conference's eighth and final playoff berth and will face the top-seeded Philadelphia 76ers in the first round.

Tatum scored 23 of his 50 points in the third quarter while Kemba Walker added 29 points for the Celtics. Bradley Beal scored a team-high 22 for Washington.

The play-in tournament will determine who will take the seventh and eighth seeded slots in each conference for the play-offs for the 2020-21 season on a one-year basis.
