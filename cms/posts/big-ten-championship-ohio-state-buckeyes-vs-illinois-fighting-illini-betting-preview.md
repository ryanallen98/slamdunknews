The spotlight will be on the Big Ten on Sunday as the final game before the Field of 68 is announced features the Ohio State Buckeyes (21-8, 12-8 Big Ten) and the Illinois Fighting Illini (22-6, 16-4 Big Ten). The Big Ten Championship from Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis is set to tip-off at 3:30pm EST. This will be the third meeting overall between the two schools after they **split the season series**, each winning on their opponent's home floor.

OHIO STATE OUTLOOK
------------------

The Buckeyes are ranked 9th in the country, but in the **loaded Big Ten**, they were the 5-seed in the conference tournament. Ohio State will have to win four games in four days to claim the crown, as they knocked off Minnesota, Purdue (in OT), and Michigan to advance to this position.

**Few could have predicted** the Buckeyes being here instead of the likes of the Wolverines, Iowa, or even the Boilermakers, but here they are despite losing their final four regular-season games. One of those losses came to this Illinois team on March 6.

Duane Washington, Jr has been in charge of the offseason during this tournament run, averaging 20 ppg in the three postseason victories, including 24 against Michigan on Saturday.

ILLINOIS OUTLOOK
----------------

The Illini are the third-ranked team in the nation but the No. 2 seed in the Big Ten bracket. They earned the double-bye into the quarterfinals, then pummelled Rutgers and soundly defeated the Hawkeyes to advance to their **first title game since 2008**. If they win on Sunday, Illinois will win their first conference tournament championship since 2005, led by James Augustine.

Dating back to January 19, the Fighting Illini have now won 13 out of their last 14 games, with the only hiccup coming on February 23 to Michigan State.

They are likely a 1-seed in the Big Dance regardless of Sunday's outcome, but a win would guarantee it, considering this has been **widely regarded as the best conference** in college basketball this season.

BETTING LINE AND PICK
---------------------

Illinois is **favored in the Big Ten Championship by 6**, with an over/under of 148. The Buckeyes are 5-1 ATS in their last 6 games as an underdog, while the Illini have covered 6 straight and are 13-3-1 ATS in their last 17 games vs. a team with a straight-up winning record.

If you are looking to play the total, consider that the Over is 5-1 in the Buckeyes last 6 games as an underdog and 4-1 in the Fighting Illini's last 5 games as a favorite.

The Big Ten has been a sight to see this year, as the semifinals featured four teams in the top 10 for the first time ever. Regardless of the matchup, it was going to be compelling, and this will be no exception. However, **Illinois is out to prove they are the best team** in the country, both on this Selection Sunday and on a certain Monday night in April.

**Free Pick: Illinois -6**
