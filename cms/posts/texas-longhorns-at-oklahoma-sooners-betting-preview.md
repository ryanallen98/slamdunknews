The spotlight is on the Big 12 on Thursday night with five games **featuring nine teams from the conference** on the slate. That includes the Texas Longhorns (15-7, 9-6 Big 12) visiting Norman for a pivotal date with the Oklahoma Sooners (14-8, 9-7 Big 12) inside the Lloyd Noble Center. Tip-off is set for 9:00pm EST on ESPN.

If the rematch is anything like the first meeting, fans are **in for a treat** as the Sooners knocked off Texas in Austin by one, thanks to some incredibly clutch late free throws back on January 26. This was originally scheduled for February 18 but postponed due to COVID concerns.

TEXAS OUTLOOK
-------------

That defeat spiraled the Longhorns into a **three-game losing streak** at the time but have since righted the ship, winning four out of their next six, including a 14-point win over Iowa State this past Tuesday. Texas is ranked 15th in the country and 5th in the Big 12, just a half-game behind Oklahoma State in what is widely considered the second-best conference in the nation.

The Longhorns are led by Andrew Jones, who averages 14.8 ppg, one of four Texas players **averaging double-figures** this season. However, the junior guard is mired in a mini-slump, posting more than 10 points just once over the last four games. Courtney Ramey is picking up some of the slack, averaging 15.8 during that same stretch.

OKLAHOMA OUTLOOK
----------------

A Sooners win on Thursday would **propel Oklahoma past Texas** in the Big 12 as the two are separated by just a half a game as well. Texas does have one game remaining on their regular-season schedule following this one, while this will be Oklahoma’s regular-season finale. But the Sooners would have the 5-spot with a win by virtue of the season sweep over the Longhorns.

OU was **rising in the rankings**, winning eight of nine from January 12 to February 20, but they have since hit the skids. The Sooners have dropped three straight, including a home-and-home with their in-state rival Cowboys. They had already fallen from the Top 10 to their current ranking (16) and could potentially fall even further in the final rankings of the season before postseason play begins.

BETTING LINE AND PICK
---------------------

Oklahoma is favored by 2 in this Big 12 showdown, with an over/under of 143.5. The Sooners **won outright as 3-point underdogs** in the first meeting, with the 159 combined points going well OVER the posted total of 143.

The loser of this game could very well be in peril of dropping to seventh in the conference, which would mean a first-round game in the Big 12 Tournament instead of a bye into the quarterfinals. Oklahoma is 8-4 ATS at home this season, but Texas has the revenge factor in play, and the Longhorns are 6-1 ATS in their last 7 games as a road underdog. Count on this coming down to the final minutes again, with **Texas covering a tight contest, potentially winning outright**.

**Pick: Texas +2**
