Last night, the Bucks 76ers, led by Giannis Antetokounmpo and Khris Middleton, ended a five-game losing streak at home.

‍

The Milwaukee Bucks beat the Philadelphia 76ers in a matchup of two of the Eastern Conference's top teams with 124-117 on to get back in the win column.

‍

The Bucks, who had lost their previous two games, were led by Giannis and Khris, who combined for 51 points. Giannis Antetokounmpo had a career-high 27 points, while Khris had had 24.

‍

The Bucks finally snapped a five-game losing streak at home with a season-high 23 points from Bobby Portis adding to their win.

‍

They increased their record to 36-22, putting Philadelphia in a more precarious place in the standings.

‍

The 76ers, who have the same record as the second-place Brooklyn Nets (39-20) after dropping their last three games, have a head-to-head advantage in the standings and will keep their top seeding for the time being.
