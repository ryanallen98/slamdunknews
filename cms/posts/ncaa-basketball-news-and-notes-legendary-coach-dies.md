The top of college basketball's rankings will stay as-is after weekend wins from Gonzaga, Baylor and Villanova. After that, things could get interesting, with Michigan and Texas getting postponed and Virginia, Alabama and Iowa falling on the road, albeit to ranked opponents. 

  

Some key matchups to keep an eye on this week include Oklahoma, fresh off three straight wins over ranked foes, visiting Texas Tech (ranked in the top 10) on Monday, a Big 12 showdown between Baylor and Texas on Tuesday, and Ohio State traveling to Iowa City to battle the Iowa Hawkeyes on Thursday.

  

Before we look ahead to those key clashes, let's look back at the top news from this past weekend across the college hoops landscape.

Legendary Temple Coach Passes Away
----------------------------------

Hall of Fame coach John Chaney has died at the age of 89 from a short, unspecified illness. Prior to arriving at Temple, Chaney coached at Division II Cheyney University, where he engineered a national championship run in 1978. He would go on to lead the Owls for 24 seasons, reaching the Elite Eight on five separate occasions.

  

Chaney won 516 games at Temple and was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2001 and the College Basketball Hall of Fame in 2006.

  

"John Chaney was a great coach, but he was so much more. For generations of Temple University students, he was a wise counselor, a dedicated teacher, an icon of success, and a passionate leader who always led by example and with conviction," Temple president Richard M. Englert said in a statement. "I am also honored to say he was a dear friend."

Richmond Forced To Pause Again
------------------------------

For the third time this season, the Richmond men's basketball program has paused all team activities due to COVID-19. Sunday's testing and contact tracing halted practices and postponed the Spiders' game against George Mason this coming Tuesday.

  

Richmond paused for COVID-19 reasons in early December, missing almost a week of basketball activity, then paused again in mid-January for a two-week stretch.

  

Richmond, which is 10-4 overall and 4-2 in the Atlantic 10, says it continues to follow the guidance of university health officials and the protocols as set by the Virginia Department of Health. There is no word on the school's plans beyond Tuesday's postponement.

NC State Loses Top Scorer
-------------------------

Devon Daniels suffered a torn ACL in the second half of the Wolfpack's win over Wake Forest on Wednesday night. Daniels will miss the remainder of the season, a huge blow to a team that snapped a four-game skid with its victory over the Demon Deacons. 

  

Daniels was averaging a career-high and team-leading 16.5 points and 3.1 assists per game for the Wolfpack this season. He ranked eighth in both points and steals per game in the ACC. 

  

The senior had transferred from Utah after his freshman year, and his scoring increased every year in Raleigh. 

  

NC State faces a tough stretch over the next two weeks with a schedule that includes games against Virginia and Duke, though both are on its home floor.
