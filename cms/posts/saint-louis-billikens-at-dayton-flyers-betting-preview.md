It’s an Atlantic-10 matchup on Friday night as the Saint Louis Billikens (11-3, 4-2 A 10) are in Dayton, Ohio, to **battle** the Flyers (11-7, 7-6 A 10) inside UD Arena. Tip-off is set for 7:00 pm EST. This is the second of two regular-season tilts between the two programs, with Dayton pulling off the upset on the road by five back on January 26. The Flyers have now won three straight in the series over the Billikens, with Saint Louis’ last win coming in the 2019 A-10 Tournament.

SAINT LOUIS OUTLOOK
-------------------

Saint Louis entered that first meeting with the Flyers as the 22nd-ranked team in the country despite **missing the previous five games** due to Covid-related postponements. They had just four days to prepare for Dayton after a 33-day absence from the basketball court, and the rust was on full display as they were playing catch-up for the entire 40 minutes.

That loss and another postponement knocked the Billikens from the Top 25, but a win Friday could propel them back as they’ve **reeled off four straight wins** by an average of more than 16 ppg dating back to February 6. They’ve played just six conference games but only sit 2.5 games behind VCU for first place in the A-10. They’ll travel to the Rams on Tuesday following Friday’s showdown with Dayton.

Javonte Perkins **leads** Saint Louis in scoring, averaging just 18 per game, having led the way in the score sheet in five of their last six. Jordan Goodwin and Yuri Collins lead the A-10 in rebounding and assists, respectively.

DAYTON OUTLOOK
--------------

The Flyers have been postponed just twice this season and will only have two games remaining following Friday’s affair with Saint Louis. They’ve played 13 conference games and sit just a half a game behind the Billikens in the A-10. However, they’ll need a **change of momentum** as Dayton has dropped two straight and three of their last four.

Last time out, the Flyers fell to Rhode Island in double overtime **despite having multiple double-digit leads**, including being up by as many as 18. Zimi Nwokeji came off the bench to play 40 minutes, pouring in a career-high 29 points in the loss.

Jalen Crutcher **leads the team** and is fourth in the Atlantic-10 in scoring with 18.9 ppg. The senior guard has eclipsed the 20-point plateau in five of the Flyers’ last eight games.

BETTING LINE AND PICK
---------------------

**Saint Louis is favored by 5.5** in this Friday night matchup in the A-10, with an over/under of 136.5. As noted, Dayton won the first meeting outright despite entering as a 9-point underdog. The 147 combined points went well over the posted total of 134.

During the Billikens’ current four-game winning streak, they are 3-1 ATS, including covering as heavy chalk against LaSalle and Fordham. They took down the Explorers by 21 as 16-point favorites and throttled the Rams by 28 as 17.5-point favorites. Dayton, meanwhile, is 2-2 ATS since the calendar turned to February. The revenge factor is in play here, but so is the look-ahead. Saint Louis is playing well, but if they’re thinking about VCU on Tuesday, they **could slip up against the Flyers**.

**Pick: Dayton +5.5**
