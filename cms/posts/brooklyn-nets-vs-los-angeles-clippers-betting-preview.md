Two of the best teams in the league meet on Sunday night when the Brooklyn Nets tangle with the Los Angeles Clippers at the Staples Center. This will be the **second time the two sides meet** this month. The Nets pulled out a 124-120 victory in Brooklyn back on February 3.

The matchup earlier this month **could have swung either way**. Kyrie Irving’s game-high 39 points paved the road for the Brooklyn win. He was helped by Kevin Durant’s 28 and a triple-double from James Harden (23-12-14).

Both teams have **hit their midseason stride**. At 22-9, the Clippers have won five of their last six and are coming off a 116-112 victory over the NBA’s best, the Utah Jazz. They are tied for second in the West and are 2.5 games back from Utah. Brooklyn has won five in a row and, at 19-12, are just a game-and-a-half back of Philadelphia for the East’s top seed.

Let’s dive into Round Two of this potential NBA Finals preview and find the **best play** for the night.

Brooklyn Nets
-------------

The Nets will once again **be without Durant** on Sunday, who will miss his seventh game this month as he deals with a hamstring issue.

In Durant’s absence, Harden and Irving have **handled the load with relative ease**. Harden has become the de-facto point guard and has double-digit assists in ten of the last 11 games. Irving has been the scoring savant playing as the off-ball guard. The duo has averaged 58 points between them over the last three contests.

After the superstars, the Nets still **appear to lack depth**. Joe Harris (15 PPG in last two weeks) and Landry Shamet (12 PPG in last two weeks) have tried to carry the weight as additional scoring options, but this team goes as its stars go.

Los Angeles Clippers
--------------------

In their last meeting, the Clippers certainly **played well enough** to win. Kawhi Leonard and Paul George combined to score 59 points on 23-of-48 shooting. Nicolas Batum added 21 on an efficient 7-of-10 and 5-of-8 from three.

Head Coach Tyronn Lue put **heavy minute totals on the starters** in that game. Four out of the five starters logged 35+ minutes. Outside of Luke Kennard’s four minutes (zero points), the team only played eight players.

The team’s balance all season has allowed them to **maintain incredible consistency**. They are one of two teams in the league to rank in the top six in points per game and points allowed per game (with Utah).

What to wager
-------------

It doesn’t matter how you handicap this game. You are going to want to tune in. The star power alone **is reason enough** to fully invest in your Sunday night. If you can’t find time for the full game, make sure you flip on the fourth quarter … That’s when the sparks are bound to fly.

The conclusion we can draw is that regardless of the score going into the fourth quarter, I expect this one to **come down to the wire**. Every possession will be critical down the stretch, and it is very hard to separate these two teams at the moment.

With Durant out, the Nets getting 5.5 points seems about right. The total, on the other hand, sounds ludicrously high at 239.5. After two hard-fought games for the Clippers against Utah, I expect their defense to carry over in this one. Give me the **under with plenty of wiggle room** for an entertaining battle.

**The Pick: Under 239.5 (-110)**
