For the second time this season, the Los Angeles Clippers and Chicago Bulls lock horns in an **inter-conference matchup** on Friday night, this time in Chicago.

The Clippers came away with a **narrow 130-127 win** back on January 10th. The game was tied heading to the fourth quarter, as Kawhi Leonard (35 pts, 14/22 FGs) and Paul George (28 pts, 9 asst) battled with Zach Lavine (45 pts, 10/16 3PFG).

To see what’s in store for round two, let’s take a look at both teams.

Los Angeles Clippers
--------------------

After a 6-4 start to the season, the Clippers began their season-best seven-game winning streak with a win over the Bulls to establish themselves as a top tier team once again. Tyronn Lue’s team has hit a mini-slump over the last week, losing three of five.

Their three losses to Brooklyn, Boston, and Sacramento came by a combined 11 points. The recent **slide has come concurrently** with George missing time. He will be sidelined for the fourth straight game with a toe injury.

Los Angeles is still **going to contend** for the #1 seed all year long. They currently sit 2.5 games back of Utah and two games behind the Lakers. Those three teams plus Milwaukee are the only teams in league with a points per game differential of +7.0 or greater. No other team is higher than +4.1.

Chicago Bulls
-------------

The Bulls are coming off the **best three-point shooting** performance in franchise history. In their 129-116 win over the Pelicans on Wednesday, Chicago netted 25 threes in 47 tries (53.2%). The 25 threes was a franchise-best and four shy of the new NBA record set by Milwaukee in December.

In the absence of Wendell Carter, Lauri Markkanen, and Otto Porter, the Bulls put up TWO 40-point quarters in their win. The team **shot 10-of-11 from distance** in the first quarter.

The team will likely **be without that trio** once again on Friday, though Carter is officially listed as doubtful for the matchup. That is a positive sign for his timetable to return, which was originally slated to be four weeks. This means he may be back sooner than expected.

With the slew of injuries, Zach LaVine continues to play at an **All-Star level**. The seventh-year guard has scored 35+ points in each of the last three games.

What to wager
-------------

In their first matchup, the Bulls shot 61% from the field and 18-33 (54.5%) from 3. Their **22 turnovers were the reason** the game slipped away from them. With no Paul George and a trio of Bulls out, the 228.5 total is liable to fluctuate in either direction.

Despite their 10-14 record, they **play nearly every game close**. Since their opening two games (which are outliers to me, as it was still basically a preseason to them after a nine-month layoff), only three of the Bulls’ twelve losses have come by more than four points. Those losses were to the Bucks, Lakers, and Celtics. Essentially, they play most games close but are more susceptible to a blowout from a top tier team. That also puts the Clippers -6.5 number in play on both sides.

With the spread and the total being difficult to play, we **look to other props**. LaVine is dominating no matter the opponent, and he has the green light to take over the offense with high volume. No Paul George means more **opportunity for LaVine** to flourish. I’ll take the **over on his points**, which sit at 28.5.

‍

**The Pick: LaVine over 28.5 points (-110)**
