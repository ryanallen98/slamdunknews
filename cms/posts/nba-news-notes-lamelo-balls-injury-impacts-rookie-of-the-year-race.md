The **NBA endured a major blow** to one of its fastest rising young stars this past weekend when **LaMelo Ball** went down with a wrist injury on Saturday against the Clippers. Reports surfaced on Sunday that **the Hornets' rookie fractured the wrist** and will miss the remainder of the season, though he is seeking a second opinion this week.

**Ball has widely been considered the runaway frontrunner to win the NBA's Rookie of the Year award**, installed as the favorite in the sportsbooks from start to finish, save for one week at the end of December. He entered Monday second among rookies in scoring and rebounding and first in assists. If Saturday was his last game of the season, he'll only have played in 41, and no player has won the award playing fewer than 50 in a season.

With that in mind, let's take a look at **three players who could overtake the young Charlotte star** when all is said and done.

Anthony Edwards, Timberwolves
-----------------------------

Minnesota made **Edwards the No. 1 overall pick in last year's NBA Draft** and, after the Ball injury, now slots in as the favorite (-155) to win the hardware. Edwards has made a run as of late, however, reaching double-figures in 10 straight games. He posted a career-high 34 points on March 14 against the Blazers and then proceeded to top that by going for 42 four nights later in an upset win over the Suns in Phoenix.

Edwards opened the season as the **second-favorite behind Ball**, inching ahead of Obi Toppin after a strong end to his first preseason.

Tyrese Haliburton, Kings
------------------------

The **21-year old was the 12th pick in this past draft out of Iowa State** and now is fourth among rookies in points per game (12.4) and second in assists (5.1) while averaging the third-most minutes (29.6).

The trade deadline is this week, and many of the Kings' more veteran players (Buddy Hield, Harrison Barnes, Marvin Bagley, Nemanja Bjelica) are the subject of trade rumors. This could accelerate the team's plan to focus its foundation on Haliburton and De'Aaron Fox moving forward and give the former the best chance to win the ROY. **His odds to begin the week are +500**.

Immanuel Quickley, Knicks
-------------------------

One of the more unlikeliest of candidates to land on this list this late into the season, **Quickley** has emerged as a **key contributor during New York's playoff push**. Quickley was the 25th pick in the draft out of Kentucky and has assumed the role of starting point guard as of late, earning the 4th-shortest odds for the Rookie of the Year award.

**Toppin** was supposed to be in this position after the Knicks took the Dayton star with the 8th overall pick, but the 23-year old hasn't been able to crack the starting five and fell out of this particular race in January.

As of now, **Ball is still listed as the second-favorite**, with odds of +170, but assuming his second opinion comes back the same as the original, he'll continue to fall. **Edwards is now in the driver's seat**, but watch out for **Haliburton** and **Quickley** down the stretch.
