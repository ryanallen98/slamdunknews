On Thursday night, two teams who have yet to settle into their consistent rotations do battle in Houston when the Rockets host the Blazers at 7:30 P.M. Eastern.

This is the second meeting of the season between the two sides, with the first coming two days after Christmas. CJ McCollum and the since forgotten James Harden each dropped 44 in an overtime affair won by the Blazers, 128-126. It was Harden’s season debut and only 40-point game this season … but enough about him, and McCollum is out for a month … Let’s focus on the two teams at present and find the right play.

Portland Trail Blazers Preview
------------------------------

Injuries have demolished the Blazers. McCollum is in a walking boot, Jusuf Nurkic has a cast on his right wrist, and Robert Covington will miss his third game in a row with a concussion.

  

Despite the litany of injuries, Portland is still hovering above .500 with a 9-7 record. Their .563 win percentage is the best in the league among teams with a negative PPG differential (-0.9).

  

The record speaks to Portland’s inconsistency. Outside of a four-game winning streak against three sub-.500 teams, the Blazers don’t have any streak of more than two games, making them even more challenging to gauge.

One could argue that Damian Lillard has “stepped up” in McCollum’s absence, but 100 points over his last three games is what we're used to seeing from the star scorer. Lillard is averaging 33 Pts, five rebounds, eight assists, and 4 3’s per game over the last two weeks.

With so many injuries, other role players have been forced to step up. From a DFS perspective, it’s hard to know who Terry Stotts wants to feature each night. Anfernee Simons (26), Carmelo Anthony (22), and Gary Trent Jr. (22) all provided a spark on Monday night in a loss to OKC. Rodney Hood is also expected back after missing a game with a thigh contusion.

Houston Rockets Preview
-----------------------

Life after James Harden has been turbulent for Houston as expected, but a three-game win streak has Rockets’ fans feeling rejuvenated. The new “Big 3” in Houston appears to be John Wall, Victor Oladipo, and Christian Wood.

Wall’s 24 points in 24 minutes against his former team on Tuesday provides hope for his revival season. Oladipo has averaged 22 PPG in his first four games as a Rocket. Wood (who put up 31 & 13 against Portland in December) is the leading candidate for the NBA’s most improved player. He is expected to return after a three-game absence due to an ankle sprain.

  

In addition, we have seen resurgent play from Demarcus Cousins (two straight double-doubles) and Eric Gordon (20+ points in five straight games).

What to Wager
-------------

Stephen Silas is getting the best out of his group, and a matchup with a banged-up Portland side is a prime opportunity to continue to gel and keep the win streak alive. It’s always hard to bet against Lillard when his back is against the wall, but he just doesn't have enough to support him at present. The Rockets happen to be the healthier of the two sides, and for that reason, I’ll happily lay the five points for a Rockets’ victory.

**The Pick: Houston Rockets (-5).**
