The Philadelphia 76ers continue their west coast road trip with a visit to the Moda Center as they **battle** the Portland Trail Blazers on Thursday night.

The Sixers are red hot at 18-7 to start their season and sit **atop** the eastern conference with a two-game lead. At 13-10, the Blazers hold the #5 seed, and they continue to tread water until they can get CJ McCollum back on the floor.

These two teams met exactly a week ago. Portland, who were also without Damian Lillard, came away with a 121-105 **victory** in Philadelphia. The Blazers outscored the Sixers 40-19 in the third quarter, while six different players hit double figures.

Let’s take a look at round two to see where we can find the best bet.

Philadelphia 76ers
------------------

This team is starting to look like the cream of the crop in the east. Doc Rivers has his Sixers motoring along with relative ease. The squad has **won nine of their last 11** games, with one of those two losses coming to Portland. That loss, however, came on the back end of a back-to-back.

Surrounded by quality veterans with championship DNA, 2021 is turning into the Joel Embiid show. Of course, the Sixers’ season as a whole is entirely dependent on his **health** along with Ben Simmons. So far, Embiid has appeared in 20 of the teams’ 25 games. That is a good percentage for a player who still requires the occasional game off.

Embiid is also getting to the free-throw line 11.5 times per game, a career-best. His 85.5 FT% is a full **five percentage points better** than a year ago. It is not out of the realm of possibilities to consider Embiid an MVP candidate.

Portland Trail Blazers
----------------------

Portland’s objective is simple, stay afloat until McCollum returns. They are **hovering around** the playoff picture for now, but the conference is extremely tight. It would only take a losing streak of four or five games to slip from fifth all the way down to the bottom. Just 3.5 games separate the 5th and 14th spots in the West.

The Blazers are 5-5 since McCollum’s last game. Though he is still in a walking boot, he is supposed to be **re-evaluated** in about a week. Others have stepped up to score in McCollum’s absence.

Five different Blazers, besides Lillard, are averaging ten-plus points over the last two weeks. The **best contributor** of the bunch has been Gary Trent Jr. The third-year pro out of Duke has played 33 or more minutes seven times since McCollum’s injury and is averaging 18.4 points per game.

What to wager
-------------

Embiid led all scorers with 37 on 14-of-21 shooting last week when these teams met. You can expect more of the same with Portland’s lack of size. His supporting cast let him down, though. The rest of the starting five shot just 11-of-34 from the field. That is **uncharacteristic** for a strong Philly supporting cast.

The Sixers are in such great form, and Portland’s only win over a team above .500 in the last month was in Philly. I expect retribution. The line is Philly -5.5, and each of the 76ers’ last five wins have come by eight or more. **Give me the Sixers at -5.5**.

**The Pick: 76ers -5.5 (-110)**
