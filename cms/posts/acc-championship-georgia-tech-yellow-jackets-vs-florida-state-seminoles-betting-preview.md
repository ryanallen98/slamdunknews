The ACC Tournament reaches its conclusion on Saturday as the (4) Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets (16-8, 11-6 ACC) take on the (2) Florida State Seminoles (16-5, 11-4 ACC) in the Championship Game. Tip-off from the Greensboro Coliseum in Greensboro, NC, is set for 8:30pm EST on ESPN. This will be the third meeting of the year between the two teams after **splitting the season series**, each winning on their home floor.

GEORGIA TECH OUTLOOK
--------------------

The Yellow Jackets earned a bye into the quarterfinal round of the ACC Tournament, defeating Miami on Thursday to advance. Virginia then became the second team in the conference (after Duke) to withdraw after a positive Covid case within the program deemed them ineligible. Georgia Tech benefited and **received an automatic pass into the finals**, their first appearance in the title game since 2010.

Despite the free pass, the Yellow Jackets are **one of the hottest teams** in the country, having won seven in a row prior to the walkover, securing themselves a spot in the field of 68. As noted, Georgia Tech has not advanced this far in 11 years, but they have not won the conference tournament since 1993 when Bobby Cremins was the head coach, and James Forrest was named tourney MVP.

Moses Wright only had 7 points and 6 rebounds in the win over Miami, but the ACC’s third-leading scorer and fourth-leading rebounder had averaged 25.8 ppg in the team’s four previous games.

FLORIDA STATE OUTLOOK
---------------------

The Seminoles had a similarly quirky path to the title game, qualifying for the bye into the quarters, only for that round’s matchup to be canceled when a member of the Duke program tested positive for Covid-19. FSU moved on to face North Carolina in Friday’s semifinals, holding off the Tar Heels for a three-point win.

Florida State won five of their final seven regular-season games, and the **only team** that prevented the ‘Noles from a 10-game winning streak this season was, ironically, the Yellow Jackets. Georgia Tech snapped FSU’s five-game streak on January 30, and Leonard Hamilton’s group proceeded to win their next four right after that.

The Seminoles lost the ACC Tournament Championship in 2019 to Duke, and their last tourney title came in 2012 when they beat UNC.

BETTING LINE AND PICK
---------------------

Florida State is **pegged as the favorite** in the ACC Championship, laying 4.5 points with an over/under of 148. The Noles won by 13 as 8-point favorites over GT on December 15, and then Tech won by 11 as 4-point dogs in the rematch a month and a half later.

The Yellow Jackets are **7-1 ATS in their last 8 games** overall, while FSU is 5-1-1 ATS in their last 7 games vs. a team with a winning % above .600.

Georgia Tech is hot, and against most teams, the one day of rest may have helped. But this **FSU team is gearing up** for a deep run in the Big Dance and will cut down the nets in Greensboro to kickstart it all.

**Pick: Florida State -4.5**
