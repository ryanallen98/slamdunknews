At 7 p.m. ET tonight, the Philadelphia 76ers will face the Phoenix Suns in a high-profile NBA matchup at Wells Fargo Center.

‍

The Phoenix Suns (41-16) begin their Eastern Conference road trip against the Philadelphia 76ers (39-18); with a strong roster, the 76ers seem capable of contending for the NBA title.

‍

The Sixers (39-18) need to strike the right balance with 15 games left before the playoffs.

‍

With a dramatic 128-127 overtime victory over the Milwaukee Bucks, the Suns began their five-game road trip against the East. The Phoenix Suns are only 1.5 games behind the Utah Jazz, who lead the Western Conference. They've won five of their last six games and twelve of their previous fourteen overall. They are 18-7 on the path, which is the best in the league.

‍

The 76ers play the Suns in the final game of their four-game homestand. They were defeated by the Golden State Warriors 106-97 on Thursday. They are half a game ahead of the Brooklyn Nets in the East and have the league's second-best home record (22-6).

‍

It's still unclear whether Simmons and Harris will be available. Reports say Simmons is dealing with a virus.

‍

Philadelphia is a defensive powerhouse, allowing just 106.6 points per 100 possessions, which ranks second in the NBA.

‍

The 76ers also cause chaos, causing a turnover on 15.2 percent of possessions and ranking second in both blocks (6.3 per game) and steals (2.4 per game) (8.9 per game).

‍

Prediction : Suns 106, 76ers 101
