The best rivalry in all of college sports is set to tip off on Saturday night, and although it doesn't carry the same excitement it has in the past, basketball fans should be in for an exciting game.

North Carolina comes into this game at 11-6 and 6-4 in ACC play and is one of the first four out in the most recent Bracketology, ranked at No. 55 in NET. Duke enters the game at 7-6 and 5-4 and are on the outside of the bubble looking in and currently sit at No. 66 NET ranking.

No other statistic summarizes the struggles these two programs are going through more than it is the first meeting since 1960 where neither of these teams is ranked.

Needing A Bounce Back
---------------------

Duke is coming off an upsetting loss to the Miami Hurricanes that snapped a four-game losing streak for the Hurricanes and ended a two-game winning streak for the Blue Devils. Sophomore forward Matthew Hurt and freshman forward Jalen Johnson are the engines to the Duke team and are players who can challenge a defense in many ways.

The Tar Heels' size is going to cause a lot of issues at the rim for Duke, and they are going to need their guard play to step up for them in this game. Jeremy Roach, who saw a lot of court time to start the season averaging 11 points per game, has seen his play and minutes steadily decline.

Roach is going to be the player to watch in this meeting as point guard play has always been one of the more important positions in basketball. Aside from his five-star status, he will more than likely be returning to Durham next season.

Up For The Rivalry
------------------

North Carolina had won three in a row before the loss to Clemson, which was 1-4 in its last five games. A 63-50 final was the lowest scoring output for the Tar Heels on the season.

The question mark still surrounding them is their motor and offensive potential. The Tar Heels rank 33rd nationally in made three=pointers per game but sit at 294th nationally in percentage at 30%.

Despite the perimeter struggles, it wouldn't be a Roy Williams team if it didn't dominate in the paint. The Tar Heels have toughness, size, and plenty of guys that can get it done under time rim in Garrison Brooks and Armando Bacot.

In two meetings against Duke last season, Brooks was dominant, averaging 22 points and nine rebounds per game while shooting 53% from the floor. Don't be surprised if Brooks puts together another strong showing against Duke.

Odds and Pick
-------------

Duke is a 1.5-point home favorite. Home court advantage has not been what it normally is, but Duke has won four straight at Cameron Indoor and should be amped up as some of these freshmen are getting their first exposure to the biggest rivalry game in sports.

The Tar Heels' lack of three-point shooting gives them a small margin for error, but if the Blue Devils can rebound and take care of the ball, they should be able to come away with a big home win.

This series is so tight that Duke has outscored the Tar Heels by just 24 points in their matchups, 3,095-3,071. This should be another competitive game as both these teams are vying for their tournament lives.
