There are several marquee matchups on the college hardwood Tuesday night, including this **Big 12 showdown** between the third-ranked Baylor Bears (18-1, 10-1 Big 12) and the sixth-ranked West Virginia Mountaineers (17-6, 10-4 Big 12). Tip-off from Morgantown is set for 5:00pm EST.

Cross your fingers that these kids actually square off as it hasn’t been in the cards this season. Because of COVID concerns, this matchup has been **postponed twice** and canceled outright on a third-occasion, so this will be the only regular-season meeting between the two high-profile programs.

Baylor Outlook
--------------

The Bears were **knocked off their undefeated perch** on Saturday, subsequently falling from No. 2 to No. 3 in the national rankings, after Kansas did what no other team could this season. With that loss, Gonzaga is the last remaining undefeated team in the country after completing a perfect 24-0 regular-season slate. Michigan ascended past Baylor in this week’s rankings after top-10 wins over Ohio State and Iowa last week.

Baylor maintains a **firm grip on a 1-seed** for the NCAA Tournament, however, closing out their regular-season schedule against WVU and then home games against nationally-ranked Oklahoma State and Texas Tech. Junior Jared Butler has led the way in this start-and-stop season for the Bears, leading the team with 16.4 ppg, which is good for fifth in the Big 12. A conference player of the year candidate, Butler is also top in steals and third in assists.

West Virginia Outlook
---------------------

The Mountaineers have **climbed the polls** in five consecutive weeks, jumping to No. 6, the highest they’ve been ranked all year after three straight wins. All told, they’ve won six out of their last seven, with their only defeat coming to Oklahoma in double overtime on February 13.

The Big 12 will send seven teams to the Big Dance, and West Virginia has a legit chance at a 2-seed, but **winning out** could see them climb even higher. They’re just a game and a half back of Baylor for the top spot in the conference heading into this late afternoon tip-off with Kansas and Oklahoma State nipping at their heels.

Miles McBride and Derek Culver **lead** a group of four Mountaineers averaging double-figures, both coming in at 15 ppg or more.

Betting Line and Pick
---------------------

Baylor is favored in this one by 4.5 points, with an over/under of 148.5. Dating back to 2017, these two programs have split their last eight games SU as they jockey for the top seed in the Big 12 Tournament. **Rust could have certainly played a factor** in Baylor’s loss to KU on Saturday, having only played twice on February 3.

WVU is 5-1 ATS in their last 6 games overall, while the Bears are 20-8-1 ATS in their last 29 games as a road favorite. If you’re looking at a play on the total, **consider the over** is 6-0 in the Bears’ last 6 games following a straight-up loss and 6-0 in the Mountaineers’ last 6 games as an underdog.

Baylor is still shaking off that rust, and we **won’t back them against a team on the rise** in this spot at home.

**Pick: West Virginia +4.5**
