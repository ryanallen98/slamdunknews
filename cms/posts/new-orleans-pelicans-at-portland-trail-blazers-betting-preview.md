The New Orleans Pelicans and Portland Trail Blazers will battle it out for the second time in three nights at the Moda Center in Portland on Thursday night. This is the third and final meeting of the season between these Western Conference foes, with Portland t**aking each of the first two games**.

The Blazers eeked out a 125-124 victory on Tuesday night thanks to more Damian Lillard heroics. The Pelicans led by 17 points halfway through the fourth quarter, but then the **clock turned to Dame Time**.

The Blazers narrowed the gap to one point with a 16-0 run. In the end, two Lillard free throws with 1.2 seconds left put the Blazers in front for the first time since 10-7 in the first quarter. He finished the game with **50 points and 10 assists, including 20 points in the fourth quarter**.

We can expect more fireworks with these two high-scoring sides on Thursday, so let's look more closely at the matchup to determine the best value bet of the night.

New Orleans Pelicans
--------------------

Ouch. There aren't many ways to heal the mental pain of **blowing a 17-point lead** with 5:57 left. The Pels can take solace in the fact that they are not the first team to fall victim to the awe-inspiring antics of a Dame Lillard fourth quarter, and they won't be the last.

Tuesday night's box score tells a more uplifting story. Brandon Ingram netted 30 points. Zion Williamson put home 28 (on 11/17 FG) and eight assists. Lonzo Ball dished out a career-best 17 assists. There is a **lot to be excited about** with this roster, but all young teams must learn how to close.

The Pelicans face a brutal schedule over the next week with six straight games against teams over .500. They currently sit in the #11 spot in the West, which would put them outside the playoff picture with the new structure that allows the #10 team a play-in opportunity.

Portland Trail Blazers
----------------------

What more can you say about a 50 & 10 night. Lillard is a Superstar, and this is how he proves it. Even by his standards, it's a **staggering stat line**. 50 points on just 20 shots (13/20 FGs and 18/18 FTs) is exceptionally effective.

It was Lillard's **first 50-point performance this season**, with the last pair coming in the August bubble in back-to-back games (61 and 51, respectively). If he wants to match his career-high for 50-point double-doubles in a season, he'll need at least two more since he did it THREE times last year.

Amazingly, **four other Blazers managed to score in double figures**, with Gary Trent's 22 (on ten shots) coming in second to Dame's 50. The other bright spot for Portland was seeing CJ McCollum return to the court. He scored ten points in 26 minutes after missing 25 games with a broken foot.

What to wager
-------------

Portland got away with one on Tuesday night, and I expect them to **lead this game from the outset**. The final result may go either way, with the Blazers favored by a point and the total set at 239.5.

There is good value in taking the Blazers to win the first quarter. I like **Portland in the first frame +2 at +130**.

**The Pick: Blazers 1Q -2 (+130)**
