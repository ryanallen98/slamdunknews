As the NBA season continues to roll on, **every night is proving to be full of surprises**. Great teams are beating bad ones, and vice versa. Superstars are putting in big scoring lines as other players continue to set career-highs in different areas.

Last night, the defending Eastern Conference champion Miami Heat **couldn't put an end to their losing skid**, falling apart late in a 103-100 defeat to the Washington Wizards.

Wizards Stun Heat
-----------------

**Russell Westbrook sat out for the Wizards yesterday**, as he generally does for parts of every doubleheader this year. However, Washington put together a strong performance without their best player. The Wizards picked up their second win in the past three games, knocking off a Heat team that is reeling right now and has lost seven of its last eight games.

The Heat can point to COVID-19 and health and safety protocol when examining their struggles. They can say that Jimmy Butler and several other vital players have been in and out of the lineup throughout the year. But **this is a game Miami should have won** and could come back to haunt them down the stretch.

At 7-14 now, there is a lot of concern about Miami, as there should be. It was hard to believe they’d trade some of their younger guys for another star, but perhaps **this situation might force their hand**.

Thunder Get Revenge on Houston
------------------------------

The Houston Rockets blew the doors off the Thunder on Monday, so when they met on Wednesday, something similar was likely to be expected. However, with John Wall out of the lineup, Houston limped to just 87 points. **Victor Oladipo shot a horrendous 8-for-24 from the floor, including 1-of-8 on three-pointers**. For the first time in a long time, Christian Wood had a below-average game. Nothing went their way in this one.

Oklahoma City was playing without their star Shai-Gilgeous Alexander, but it didn’t seem to matter. Hamidou Diallo entered the starting lineup and continued to impress, finishing with 16 points and nine rebounds. Even with Lu Dort limited to just nine minutes, they were able to secure the win. **Kenrich Williams paced the team with 19 points**, while Darius Bazley finished with a double-double (18 points and 12 rebounds).

It’s always great to win, but it’s sweeter when it’s against the team that destroyed you a few days earlier. OKC continues to be a **sneaky good team in the West**.

Giannis’ Triple-Double Lifts Bucks to Victory
---------------------------------------------

The Pacers lost to the Bucks by 20 last night, trailing by more than 30 points for long stretches of the second half.

Giannis Antetokounmpo posted his third triple-double of the year, finishing with 21 points, 14 rebounds, and 10 assists in 31 minutes. He didn’t play in the fourth quarter, making his day that much more impressive. Equally important were the 20 points Bryn Forbes scored off the bench, as his ability to put it in the hoop gave them a consistent option outside of the big three.

Domantas Sabonis posted 33 points, 12 rebounds, and six assists for the Pacers in the loss. He is averaging 21 points and 12 rebounds this season, which should merit him **All-Star Game honors**.
