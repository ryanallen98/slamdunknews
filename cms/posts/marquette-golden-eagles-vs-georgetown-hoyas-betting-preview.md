The Big East Tournament **gets underway** on Wednesday with a matchup between the (8) Marquette Golden Eagles (13-13, 8-11 Big East) and the (9) Georgetown Hoyas (9-12, 7-9 Big East). Tip-off from Madison Square Garden in New York City is set for 3:00pm EST on FS1. These two met just once during the regular season, with Marquette winning by four on the road, and the second meeting was postponed on January 20 due to COVID-related issues within the Hoyas program.

MARQUETTE OUTLOOK
-----------------

The Golden Eagles enter the conference tournament, having won their final two games of the regular season and four out of their last five. Marquette **rebounded down the stretch nicely** after a slide that saw them lose six of seven from January 23-February 14.

Two years ago, in Marquette’s **last postseason appearance**, Steve Wojciechowski’s group won their first-round matchup against St. John’s but then fell in the quarterfinals to Seton Hall. They qualified for the NCAA Tournament with an at-large bid where they fell to Murray State in the opening round in a game that featured two of the top three scorers in the country in MU’s Markus Howard and MSU’s Ja Morant.

That year, Howard averaged 25.0 ppg, and this year, Marquette is led by Dawson Garcia’s 13.2 ppg and 6.7 rpg.

GEORGETOWN OUTLOOK
------------------

The Hoyas experienced some **late-season success** as well, winning four out of their final six games, though they fell to UConn in their regular-season finale on Saturday. December and January were tough months for Patrick Ewing’s bunch, as they endured a five-game losing streak from December 20-January 9 and then paused all team activities following a COVID outbreak that extended until January 30.

All told, Georgetown went 48 days between wins during one of the more difficult stretches in the history of the program.

The Hoyas are looking for a program-defining win on Wednesday as they **have not won** a Big East Tournament game since 2016, and they haven’t won two games in the conference tourney since 2010.

BETTING LINE AND PICK
---------------------

Marquette is **favored in this Big East Tournament first-round tilt by 3**, with an over/under of 144. The Golden Eagles are 11-15 ATS this season, while the Hoyas are 12-9 against the number. Marquette is 5-1 ATS in their last 6 games overall, and the OVER is 5-1-1 in their last 7 Wednesday games. Georgetown is 4-0 ATS in their last 4 games following an ATS loss and 8-3 ATS in their last 11 games overall.

Marquette’s Jamal Cain poured in a career-high in the first meeting, but both of these teams are drastically different from that January 2nd matchup. The winner of this game faces a vulnerable Villanova team in the quarters, so a win on Wednesday, and it’s possible we’ll see one of these two in the semi-finals on Friday. Both are in desperate need of a win to calm any coaching hot-seat rumors, and we **expect the Hoyas to exact some revenge** to move on.

**Pick: Georgetown +3**
