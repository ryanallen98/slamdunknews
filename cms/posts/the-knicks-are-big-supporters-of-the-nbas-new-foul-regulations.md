The Knicks aren't one of the clubs complaining about the NBA's new regulations aimed at limiting fouls called on non-basketball plays.

 

While James Harden and the Nets, as well as other stars throughout the league have expressed displeasure with the adjustments, coach Tom Thibodeau and the rising Knicks continue to support the instruction to limit offensive players' initiating contact to draw fouls.

 

“Yeah. F— yeah,” said Evan Fournier, following Saturday's triumph in New Orleans. “It was actually very frustrating for me. For years I don’t like to compare anything but coming from Europe we have guys that aren’t as physical, aren’t as athletic, and yet the game is more physical there.”

 

“So as a rookie, I kept fouling and fouling and fouling. And I was like, ‘What the hell?’ I’m skinny. I’m not strong. So I think the league did a great job, and we have to adapt and adjust. I think as a fan, it’s better. You don’t want to see guys just trying to trick referees all the time. … I like it, 100 percent.”

 

“If you went back to 20 years ago, and some of us can, you’d have to make an aggressive move to the basket to get two free throws,” Thibodeau said. “The intent is to have a rhythm. If a player makes an aggressive move to the basket and he gets fouled, he should be given two free throws, but if you’re trying to trip up the game, in the old days, the veteran officials, they’d call the foul on the offensive player. That usually eliminated it right there."
