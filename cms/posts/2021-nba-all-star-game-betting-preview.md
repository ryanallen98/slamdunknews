We have arrived at the midway point of the **NBA** season, and our reward is the **All-Star Game** on Sunday night in Atlanta. It is the fourth year of captains making schoolyard picks to determine the teams, rather than the traditional East vs. West format.

LeBron James has been a captain all four years. In 2018, he was a captain alongside **Stephen Curry**, while **Giannis Antetokounmpo** was his rival each of the last two years. This year, **Kevin Durant** picked with LeBron, but he will not play while nursing a hamstring strain.

Team LeBron has won each of the last three years, with last year being the first test of the “**Elam Ending**,” which we will cover below. Let’s look at both teams and figure out the best way to wager on this year’s game.

The Elam Ending
---------------

For the second year in a row, the game will be decided with the **Elam Ending**, a tested theory to bring a basketball game to a more exciting conclusion.

After three 12-minute quarters (all starting at 0-0), the scores will be added up for the start of the fourth quarter. The “target score,” or score to end the game, will be the leading team’s total PLUS 24 points (in honor of **Kobe Bryant**).

This ending created an extremely competitive atmosphere last year, and we can expect the same once again in 2021.

Team LeBron
-----------

**LeBron** has once again put the better team together on paper following the All-Star Game draft. The 17-time All-Star used his first pick to take Giannis and came back with Steph, Luka Doncic, and Nikola Jokic for his starting five.

His bench is led by **Damian Lillard**, **Ben Simmons**, and **Jaylen Brown**. Chris Paul, who came off the bench in the fourth quarter to seal the win last year, is also on Team LeBron. Brown is the only first-time ASG selection on this “veteran” All-Star team.

Team Durant
-----------

**Durant** drafted five starters instead of four since he is not playing this year. He grabbed his teammate Kyrie Irving with his first pick. He followed that up with big man Joel Embiid, Kawhi Leonard, Bradley Beal, and Jayson Tatum.

The first bench pick made by **Durant** was his other teammate, **James Harden**. Durant also took the All-Stars coming from second-tier teams. Zion Williamson, Zach LaVine, Julius Randle, and Mike Conley will all make their first appearances in an All-Star Game. Nikola Vucevic and Donovan Mitchell will appear for the second time in their careers.

What to wager
-------------

**Team LeBron** are listed as four-point favorites with the total set at 313.5. Keep in mind that last year, LeBron’s squad were trailing by nine points heading into the fourth quarter. That made it very difficult for the favored team to win. They still outscored Team Giannis 33-22 in the final frame but only ended up winning the game by two.

In addition, the lower-scoring fourth quarter pushed the point total down to 312, a much lower total than previous games. This number has become harder to pinpoint every year, especially with the **Elam Ending**.

**LeBron does not like to lose**, and he clearly takes this game seriously despite its exhibition status. I would have no issue with taking his side -4 if you choose to, but given the strange format once again, I’m not comfortable laying ANY points on any side.

I’m looking at **Zion** here. Players in their first **ASG** don’t get many opportunities, and I don’t expect him to eclipse his point total of 13.5.

The Pick: Zion Williamson under 13.5 points (+105)
