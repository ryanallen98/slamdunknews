Tuesday night’s matchup between the Brooklyn Nets and Sacramento Kings pits the **league’s best offense** against the worst defense. This is the second meeting between these two teams in the last eight days, with the Nets grabbing a 136-125 win in Sacramento the last time out.

In that contest, the Kings kept the game close until halfway through the third quarter. Sacramento got as close as 82-80 before the Nets **ballooned the lead** to 28 in the fourth quarter. Without Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving dropped 40 points (15/22 FG, 9/11 3FG), and James Harden notched a triple-double (29-13-14).

Let’s find the **best play** for Tuesday night’s meeting.

Sacramento Kings
----------------

After a 3-1 start to the season, life as a Kings fan was starting to provide hope. With just three wins over the ensuing 13 games, all hope was wiped away. The roller coaster continued when the team then rattled off seven wins in the next eight games. They had crawled back over .500, and **balance was seemingly restored**.

On the heels of the winning run, the Kings are now actively trying to **kick a seven-game losing streak** to the curb. Sadly, these types of streak have been all too common for a team and city that has been starved of playoff basketball since 2006.

If they can find some consistency, a spot in the play-in round isn’t out of the question. At 12-18, they **currently sit 2.5 games back** of the final two spots in this year’s new playoff format.

Brooklyn Nets
-------------

The Nets are streaking in a different way. With **six consecutive wins** (five of which without Durant), Brooklyn is now half a game back of Philadelphia for the top seed in the East. It is the first time they have won six straight since January of 2019.

The team continues to roll, even without KD, who will miss his fifth straight game with a hamstring injury. The league will **take notice after three impressive wins** against some of the Western Conference’s best teams, the Suns, Lakers, and Clippers.

The streak has a **chance to hit double digits** before the All-Star Break. Their remaining four games beyond Tuesday night are against Orlando, Dallas, San Antonio, and Houston.

What to wager
-------------

There is no way to sugarcoat it; these two teams **don’t play much defense**. The Nets (117 Opp. PPG) and Kings (119.6 Opp. PPG) are 28th and 30th in the league, respectively. On top of that, Brooklyn’s 121 PPG is the best in the NBA.

The last time these two squads met, they combined to put up 261 points. The total currently sits at 242. While I wouldn’t blame anyone for wanting to take the over, I have trepidation about numbers that climb that high. Too many things **need to go right** to win that bet. Keep in mind that the Kings have only hit 242 twice in their last 12 games.

For that reason, I turn my attention **to the 7.5 points the Nets are giving**. Outside of the Suns and Clippers games, the Nets have won four of their last six by ten or more. Meanwhile, the Kings have lost all seven of their games by eight or more points during their current losing streak.

There is no need to overthink this one. Take the **team with the winning streak**.

**The Pick: Nets -7.5 (-110)**
