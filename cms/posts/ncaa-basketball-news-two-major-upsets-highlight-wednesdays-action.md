Gonzaga and Baylor maintained their stranglehold on the top two spots in college basketball’s Top 25. Both are undefeated and have the look of Final Four contenders. Iowa joined the Bears as the two Top 10 teams to emerge victorious on Tuesday, with Texas the only program in that category to fall. The Longhorns lost to Baylor in the most highly-anticipated matchup of the night.

Wednesday was a little different story, with two Top 5 teams going down in major upsets. Let’s explore those surprise results from the collegiate hardwood.

Villanova Stormed by St. John's
-------------------------------

After an undefeated start to Big East play, Villanova’s winning streak was snapped in Queens following an 11-point loss to St. John’s. With an effective full-court press and impressive interior defense, St. John’s controlled the tempo of the game and forced 17 Villanova turnovers, the highest total in a game this season.

The Red Storm’s suffocating defense held Villanova to 32% from the field, and the Wildcats never seemed to find an answer to St. John’s shot-blocking and tenacity. The Johnnies shot 43% from three-point range and came out of halftime looking sharp, as they scored seven unanswered to start the second half.

Leading the way for the Red Storm was Posh Alexander. The impressive freshman had 16 points, six assists, and three steals. Supporting Alexander was Julian Champagnie, and while the Big East’s leading scorer had a quiet first half, he came alive late and grabbed 11 rebounds along with 14 late points.

Villanova had won nine in a row before Wednesday night, holding a steady as the No.3 team in the country. They will likely fall in next week’s rankings, but they’ll have a chance to right the ship with another Big East test Saturday against Georgetown, who just pulled off an upset of their own.

A Problem for Houston
---------------------

Jayden Gardner scored 21 points and added 15 rebounds to help East Carolina stun No. 5 Houston, earning the Pirates their first win against a ranked opponent since 2002.

Tremont Robinson-White chipped in with 17 points for East Carolina, which finally found a way to score against one of the nation’s best defensive units. East Carolina shot 47% from the floor and made 11 of 24 three-pointers. The Pirates held the lead for the last 12-plus minutes against a Houston team that struggled to make much of anything after halftime.

Between five straight losses and three postponements, East Carolina (8-6, 2-6 American Athletic Conference) hadn’t won a game in more than a month .

DeJon Jarreau matched his career-high with 25 points to lead the Cougars (15-2, 10-2). Houston had won nine straight meetings dating back to 2015. That span included wins by double-digit margins on ECU’s home floor in each of the past four seasons. But top-scorer Quentin Grimes struggled, notching just seven points on 2-for-10 shooting.

The upset wasn’t exclusive to just top-10 teams on Wednesday night, as Creighton, Virginia Tech, and Florida all fell to unranked squads as well, the Bluejays and Gators doing so on their home floors.
