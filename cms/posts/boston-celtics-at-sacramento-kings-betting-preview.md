The Boston Celtics travel north of San Francisco for the second leg of their back-to-back when they visit the Sacramento Kings at Golden 1 Center on Wednesday night.

The Celtics are in the midst of a five-game trip out west, while the Kings return home following a successful journey out east. Let's take a look at these teams' trajectories and find some value.

Boston Celtics
--------------

The Celtics have been led in scoring by either Jaylen Brown (10 times) or Jayson Tatum (nine times) in every game this season. Tatum did not miss a beat after an eight-game absence, but the team has dropped two of its last three games.

The Celtics did pick up a 111-107 win Tuesday night in Golden State. Boston outrebounded the Warriors 51-36, with Daniel Theis (11 rebounds) and Brown (10) dominating the glass.

Injuries continue to be an issue, however, preventing Boston from letting its favored unit gel. Marcus Smart will miss his third game with a left calf strain and is expected to be out a few weeks.

The Nos. 4 through 10 spots in the Eastern Conference are occupied by teams within three games of .500. With Boston sliding to 11-8 after its 8-3 start, its West Coast swing to start February becomes crucial.

Following Sacramento, the Celtics will travel to see the Clippers, Suns and Jazz, three of the top five teams in the Western Conference.

Sacramento Kings
----------------

The Kings began the season with three wins through four games, but the season started to unravel once the calendar turned to 2021. Sacramento proceeded to lose nine of its first 11 games in January. Five of those nine losses came by 19 points or more.

Four wins in the Kings' last five games have partially righted the ship. All four wins, however, came against teams with sub-.500 records.

They return to Sacramento to play seven of their next eight games at home, but the opponents don't get any easier. Over the next seven games, all but one team the Kings face are over .500.

De'Aaron Fox will be disappointed the Kings don't have the Pelicans on the current schedule anymore. He torched them on Monday night for 38 points and 12 assists after dropping 43 and 13 on them two weeks ago.

His one downfall over the last three games has been turnovers (6.0 per game). Fox will need to distribute more efficiently against a solid Celtics defense for the Kings to compete.

What To Wager
-------------

This game is crying out to be played simply. There is no reason to overthink it.

The Celtics have handled mediocre teams when Tatum is healthy, and the Kings have not shown any growth against teams with quality. The Kings are a mediocre team, and Boston is a team with quality.

The Celtics' top 10 defense will focus on Fox, forcing others to make plays. On the other side, Tatum and Brown should eat against the second-worst defense in the league (119.7 points per game allowed).

The line opened at Boston -2.5, and I suspect it may stretch by a point or two when all is said and done. The Celtics need this win to cushion their road trip record at 2-0 before facing the real threats out west.

The Pick: Celtics -2.5
