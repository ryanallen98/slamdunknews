A pair of **bottom-dwellers** stuck on 11 wins meet in Houston on Friday night when the **Detroit Pistons** take on the **Houston Rockets**. Sporting two of the league’s three worst records, both sides have plummeted out of the playoff picture.

This is the second and final meeting of the season between these two teams this year. The **Rockets narrowly edges the Pistons, 103-102, on January 23**. Eric Gordon led the way with 20 points for Houston. Ironically, that win for Houston started a six-game winning streak before the wheels fell off.

Let’s see where both of these teams stand now and pick out **the best bet**.

Detroit Pistons
---------------

Life is difficult for the team with the worst record in the **Eastern Conference**. The Pistons are in a bad way because of their lack of direction. Sure, it’s bad this year … But is there any forward momentum for next season?

The team has three wins since February 16 and are 3-10 in that span. **Two of those three wins have come against a depleted Toronto side**. The other win came against Orlando, the team with the SECOND-worst record in the east, two nights after losing to them in the first game of a mini-series.

Strangely enough, both **Mason Plumlee and Dennis Smith Jr. have registered triple-doubles this month**. Jerami Grant continues to lead the charge for the NBA’s Most Improved Player, averaging 23.4 points per game this season, but there is little else to be excited about.

Houston Rockets
---------------

The **Rockets have not won since February 5**. They have lost 18 straight games after their defeat to Golden State on Wednesday night. The losing streak is a new franchise record, surpassing a 17-game skid from 1968, the franchise’s inaugural season in San Diego.

The streak is the longest in the league since the Knicks dropped 18 in a row in 2019. One more loss would put them among the top 15 for the longest losing streaks in **NBA** history.

There are silver linings surrounding the **dark clouds of Houston’s season**. The team needs to figure out who will make up their young core moving forward.

**Christian Wood returned after missing 17 games with an ankle injury**. The Rockets will be happy to get their big man back to full strength, as he has averaged 22 points and ten rebounds per game this season.

With John Wall and Eric Gordon out, **Kevin Porter Jr.** has been dynamic in five games since returning from the G-League. He is averaging 19.6 points, 8.0 rebounds, and 1.8 steals in 35 minutes per game. Wall is questionable for Friday, but Porter Jr. should see an extended run for the rest of the season.

What to wager
-------------

If there was ever a contest that a team on an 18-game losing streak should be favored, it’s this one. The **Rockets are 2.5-point favorites** on Friday night.

All streaks must come to an end, and the team on the floor in **Houston is not the same team that has lost every game of this streak**. Wood is back. Oladipo is healthy. Porter Jr. and Kenyon Martin Jr. are quality contributors.

I like the **Rockets to break their streak** against the lowly Pistons.

**The Pick**: Rockets -2.5 (-110)
