The Bucks scored 22 out of 53 three-point attempts in the 132-98 win.

In the first half, Bryn Forbes hit five three-pointers, and Giannis Antetokounmpo finished with 31 points.

Meanwhile, the Denver Nuggets fought back to tie the Portland Trail Blazers 1-1 in the series. In the 128-109 win, Nikola Jokic had 38 points and Michael Porter Jr had 18.

Meanwhile, LeBron James of the Los Angeles Lakers will not be punished for violating NBA health and safety regulations by attending a promotional event, as the league determined that he did not pose a risk of spreading Covid-19.

James was taken without a mask at an outdoor photoshoot for his tequila brand with many celebrities before the Lakers' 103-100 win over the Golden State Warriors last week, according to reports.
