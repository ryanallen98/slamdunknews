No. 2 Baylor Set To Resume Play After COVID-19 Pause
----------------------------------------------------

The No. 2 Baylor Bears basketball program is set to resume games **after a three-week hiatus** due to COVID-19 protocols.

The Bears **have not played** since Feb. 2 when they beat Texas in Austin, 83-69.

Baylor is set to resume against Iowa State on Feb. 23 in Waco. The Bears **only have one other game currently scheduled** after that, as the rest are up in the air at the moment due to a lack of time to make them all up before the Big XII tournament.

The Big XII has already said that all of Baylor’s games will not be rescheduled as there just is **not enough time** to make them up.

The Bears will look to build on their 17-0 start to the season, their **best in school history**.

Boston College Axes Head Coach Midseason
----------------------------------------

Boston College has seen enough of Jim Christian at the helm of their basketball program. Deep into his seventh season, he was **fired by the school** this week.

Christian had a **successful two-season** stint at Ohio University before making the jump to BC and the ACC competition.

After seven seasons, it is clear he was **not cut out for the job** as the Eagles went 26-94 (.217) in the ACC and 78-132 (.371) overall under Christian.

Boston College unsurprisingly **did not qualify** for the NCAA Tournament in Christian’s seven seasons and only made one short trip to the NIT in 2018 with a first-round exit.

Duke’s Jalen Johnson Foregoing Remainder Of Season
--------------------------------------------------

Duke Forward Jalen Johnson will enter the 2021 NBA Draft and has **decided to forgo the remainder of this season** to prepare for it.

Johnson has dealt with some lingering foot injuries this season that he **wants to fully heal** in time to be prepared for the 2021 NBA Draft in June.

His minutes have also been inconsistent lately, which have **led some to believe** there is trouble in the air between Johnson and the Duke coaching staff.

Coach K has **openly expressed his support** of Johnson moving on and healing up prior to entering the Draft.

Duke does not appear headed to the NCAA Tournament this season, so from a national exposure standpoint, Johnson didn’t stand much to gain by staying.

KenPom Gets WCC Tournament Deal
-------------------------------

Ken Pomeroy, NCAA Basketball ranking extraordinaire, has **struck a deal** with the West Coast Conference to seed their Men’s and Women’s basketball tournaments this season.

The ever-popular ranking site KenPom.com is Pomeroy’s analytical ranking of every NCAA college basketball team. Using **advanced metrics and analytics**, the algorithm ranks teams accordingly.

With the **unique situation** of COVID-19, the WCC has not been able to play all of its conference games. Some teams have played double-digit conference games, while others have played less than six.

Pomeroy has created seeding based on adjusted conference win percentage. He **based the data on** who each team played, when, and where those games took place.
